# Significant Development Cost Savings Using RESTHeart

{: .text-justify .mt-5 .mb-5}
RESTHeart is a standalone server-side application which connects to MongoDB database (and MongoDB compatible databases) and immediately exposes all of MongoDB’s capabilities through a complete REST API, which allows to read and write JSON documents and binary data via HTTP.

Developers don’t need to write a single line of backend code to serve data and content to Mobile Apps and Angular, React, Vue or other Single Page Application frameworks.

RESTHeart provides a strong security module for authentication, authorization, and data caching. It allows to effectively manage content and its metadata, such as images, tags, categories, geo-localized data, audios and videos, allowing to access them through a clean REST API.

In most scenarios, RESTHeart can be the perfect server-side backend for mobile and web applications, so that frontend developers can focus on building user Interfaces.
