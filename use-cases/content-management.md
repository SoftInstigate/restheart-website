Many RESTHeart users use RESTHeart to effectively manage content—whether that content is images, audios, videos, comments, tags, categories, or geo-localized data and whether the application is mobile or on the web. Because RESTHeart eliminates the need for time-consuming integrations, in most cases you can set up your content management application without coding—saving significant development cost.
You can build Single Page Applications with Angular, React, Vue frameworks and iOS and Android Mobile applications much more effectively because you can focus on creating beautiful user interfaces for your users.
