Data can be uploaded to RESTHeart via JSON calls or Excel's CSV files and made immediately available through the REST API.

RESTHeart allows for high performance, live streaming of real-time data from MongoDB. For more information see [Websocket API](/docs/mongodb-websocket/) documentation page.

RESTHeart also leverages MongoDB's Geospatial support and stores GeoJSON objects without the need to write complicated server-side code: geometries are then available to clients such as Google Maps via its API.
