## What is RESTHeart?

RESTHeart is a framework for building HTTP microservices that aims to empower developers with intuitive APIs out of the box. It is built for developers, with a focus on simplicity, speed and ease of use.

It provides features commonly needed by applications like authentication/authorization and data management through MongoDB integration.

It has a modular architecture where core functionality is provided by restheart-core, and additional features are implemented as plugins.

## Is it Open Source?

Absolutely! RESTHeart is released under the AGPL Open Source License, along with an Enterprise License.

The complete codebase is open source, and there are no distinctions in features between the AGPL and Enterprise License.

The Enterprise License is specifically designed for organizations seeking extra assurances and professional support.

## How does it support MongoDB?

The MongoDB plugin exposes the full database capabilities through REST, GraphQL and Websockets with no backend code required. This cuts development time significantly.

## What security features are supported?

RESTHeart offers comprehensive authentication and authorization services, supporting various security schemes. It enables the management of users and permissions directly in MongoDB collections, eliminating the need for backend code. This streamlined approach significantly reduces development time.

## Why restheart is classified as a low code framework?

RESTHeart is classified as a low-code framework because it offers developers customizable APIs that are ready to go. It aims to empower developers with an intuitive framework that encompasses essential features, allowing them to build applications without the need to reinvent the wheel. RESTHeart provides pre-configured APIs that cover a broad range of functionality and are highly customizable to fit specific application needs. This approach reduces the amount of code developers need to write, streamlining the development process and making it easier and faster to build cloud-native HTTP microservices.

## Which languages the SDK support?

RESTHeart SDK supports Java, Kotlin, JavaScript and TypeScript. Hello World examples are very simple to implement in any of these languages.

## What about performances?

Performance is a priority with support for huge throughput, horizontal scaling, and GraalVM for better performance in containers.

It is designed for microservices deployment in Docker/Kubernetes and can run as a standalone JAR, native binary or Docker image.

## What categories of plugins are available?

There are four types of plugins in RESTHeart:

1. Services: These plugins extend the API by adding web services.
2. Interceptors: These plugins snoop and modify requests and responses at different stages of the request lifecycle.
3. Initializers: These plugins execute initialization logic at system startup time.
4. Providers: These plugins provide objects to other plugins via the `@Inject` annotation.

Additionally, it is also possible to develop security plugins to customize the security layer.

## Does the SDK provide a Dependency Injection feature?

Yes! Dependency injection in RESTHeart works by using the `@Inject` and `@OnInit` annotations in conjunction with provider classes.

To implement dependency injection, a provider class must implement the `Provider` interface and be annotated with `@RegisterPlugin`. The provider class provides the object that will be injected into other classes.

Overall, dependency injection in RESTHeart allows for the easy injection of provided objects into other classes, reducing the need for manual object creation and management.
