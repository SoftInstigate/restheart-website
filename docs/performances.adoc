=== Blazing Fast

RESTHeart has been designed and developed with a focus on lightweight architecture and performance. This section presents performance test results gathered by the SoftInstigate development team.


**IMPORTANT:** Starting from RESTHeart version 8, Virtual Threads, a feature introduced in Java 21 via link:http://openjdk.org/jeps/444[JEP 444], are used. These lightweight threads provide significant performance improvements and simplify concurrent programming.

=== Test Outcome in a Nutshell

##With RESTHeart, you can serve 2.6 million authenticated requests on the *MongoDB REST API* in just 5 minutes using a single server with only 4 cores.##

=== MongoDB REST API Performance

This test evaluates the *throughput* and *latency* of performing GET requests on a MongoDB collection using the RESTHeart REST API.

The requests are authenticated using Basic Authentication and the `mongoRealAuthenticator` (which authenticates users defined in a MongoDB collection) to simulate real-world usage scenarios.

The following startup log message shows the Threads configuration used in the test:

[source,bash]
---
10:56:49.167 [main] INFO  org.restheart.Bootstrapper - Available processors: 4, IO threads: 1, worker scheduler parallelism (auto detected): 3, worker scheduler max pool size: 256
---

The log message highlights the following threads setup:

- Available processors: 4
- IO threads: 1
- worker scheduler parallelism: 3
- worker scheduler max pool size: 256

The Virtual Threads are unlimited and are executed by the JVM using 3 platform threads. (Note that these are not the default values that are: `io-threads=number of cores` and `worker-threads-scheduler-parallelism=1.5*number of cores`).

The following screenshot shows the result of a performance test measured with the link:/docs/monitoring[monitoring] feature of RESTHeart that allows plotting data with link:https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus].

Here is the average rate of `GET /coll` requests executed with the performance tool `wrk`. The requests retrieve documents stored in a MongoDB collection using the REST API. The average rate reaches about *8,700 Requests/sec* on a `c7a.xlarge` AWS EC2 instance (with 4 cores).

This is the output of wrk, showing a throughput of *8,690 Requests/sec*, an amazing total of *2.61 millions GET requests executed* in 5 minutes ðŸš€ and an average latency of *18,34ms* (75% percentile) with a JSON payload of 411 bytes.

=== Change Streams

Measure RESTHeart's notification throughput while _n_ Websockets are listening for targeted notifications.
RESTHeart will process 180 POSTs in 60 seconds while testing (3 RPS) and every client will wait until all notification have been received.

Observing the graph, RESTHeart delivers almost real-time notification for a very huge amount of clients:
