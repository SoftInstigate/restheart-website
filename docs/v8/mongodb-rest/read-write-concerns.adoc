RESTHeart provides flexible ways to configure read and write operations for MongoDB, allowing you to specify these concerns at both the connection and request levels.

=== Configuration Options

You can specify read and write concerns in two primary ways:

=== 1. MongoDB Connection String Configuration

In the MongoDB client configuration, you can set default read and write concerns using the connection string:

[source]
----
mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb?readPreference=primaryPreferred&readConcern=majority&writeConcern=majority
----

=== 2. Request-Level Query Parameters

RESTHeart extends the MongoDB write API by allowing you to specify read and write concerns directly in the request query parameters.

==== Read Preferences

You can specify the read preference using the `readPreference` query parameter:

[source]
----
GET /mycollection?readPreference=primary
GET /mycollection?readPreference=primaryPreferred
GET /mycollection?readPreference=secondary
GET /mycollection?readPreference=secondaryPreferred
GET /mycollection?readPreference=nearest
----

==== Read Concerns

Set read concerns with the `readConcern` query parameter:

[source]
----
GET /mycollection?readConcern=local
GET /mycollection?readConcern=majority
GET /mycollection?readConcern=linearizable
GET /mycollection?readConcern=snapshot
----

==== Write Concerns

Specify write concerns using the `writeConcern` query parameter:

[source]
----
POST /mycollection?writeConcern=majority
PUT /mycollection?writeConcern=w:2
DELETE /mycollection?writeConcern=w:1
----

=== Supported Values

==== Read Preferences
* `primary`: Reads only from the primary node
* `primaryPreferred`: Reads from primary, falls back to secondary
* `secondary`: Reads only from secondary nodes
* `secondaryPreferred`: Reads from secondary, falls back to primary
* `nearest`: Reads from the node with the lowest network latency

=== Read Concerns
* `local`: Returns the most recent data available
* `majority`: Returns data that has been acknowledged by a majority of replica set members
* `linearizable`: Ensures read operations reflect the most recent write operations
* `snapshot`: Returns data from a snapshot of the data at the time of the read operation

=== Write Concerns
* `w:0`: No acknowledgment
* `w:1`: Acknowledgment from primary
* `w:majority`: Acknowledgment from a majority of replica set members
* Numeric values (w:2, w:3) specify the number of nodes that must acknowledge the write

=== Example Use Cases

==== Reading from Nearest Node
[source]
----
GET /users?readPreference=nearest
----

=== Writing with Majority Acknowledgment
[source]
----
POST /transactions?writeConcern=majority
----

=== Consistent Read After Write
[source]
----
GET /orders?readConcern=majority&readPreference=primary
----

=== Best Practices

* Use `majority` write concern for important transactions to ensure data durability
* Choose read preferences based on your application's consistency and latency requirements
* Consider network topology and replica set configuration when selecting read and write concerns

=== Notes

* Request-level query parameters override connection string configurations
* Not all combinations of read and write concerns are appropriate for every use case
* Carefully evaluate performance implications of your chosen read and write concerns
