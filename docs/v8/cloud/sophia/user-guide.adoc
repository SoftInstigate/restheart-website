== Getting Started

Sophia is an intelligent AI designed to provide helpful information and support. This guide will help you make the most of your interactions with Sophia.

== Accessing Sophia

=== Web Interface
Sophia can be accessed through a web browser at the URL provided by your administrator. The interface is responsive and works on desktop computers, tablets, and mobile devices.

=== Embedded Integration
Sophia can also be embedded in other websites or applications through iframe integration, providing seamless access within your existing workflow.

== Using the Chat Interface

=== Starting a Conversation

Beginning your interaction with Sophia is intuitive and straightforward. Navigate to the Sophia web interface through your organization's designated URL, where you'll immediately see the clean, user-friendly chat interface. The text input field is prominently located at the bottom of the screen, where you can type your questions in natural, conversational language. Once you've composed your question, simply press Enter or click the send button to submit your query. Sophia will then process your request and provide a comprehensive response based on the information available in your organization's knowledge base.

=== Chat Features

==== Real-time Responses
Sophia delivers an enhanced user experience through its sophisticated real-time response system. Rather than waiting for a complete response to be generated, you can watch as Sophia composes answers in real-time through progressive text streaming. The interface provides clear visual feedback during processing, displaying typing indicators that let you know Sophia is actively working on your request. This streaming approach allows you to begin reading and understanding responses as they're being generated, creating a more natural and engaging conversational flow.

==== Message History
The system maintains comprehensive conversation continuity throughout your session, ensuring that you never lose track of your interactions with Sophia. All previous messages are clearly displayed above the current conversation area, creating a complete historical record of your session. You can easily scroll up through the conversation history to review earlier questions and responses, making it simple to reference previous information or build upon earlier discussions. This persistent history feature enables more complex, multi-part conversations where later questions can build upon earlier context.

==== Message Formatting
Sophia's responses incorporate sophisticated rich text formatting capabilities that enhance readability and comprehension. The system uses *bold text* strategically for emphasis on key points and concepts, while _italic text_ provides subtle emphasis for nuanced information. Technical terms and code references are clearly distinguished through dedicated `code formatting` that makes them easy to identify and copy. When appropriate, responses include links to external resources that provide additional context or detailed information. The system intelligently formats information into bulleted and numbered lists when presenting multiple related points, and longer code examples are displayed in properly formatted code blocks that preserve spacing and syntax highlighting.

=== Language Selection

Sophia offers comprehensive multilingual support designed to accommodate diverse user communities and international organizations. The system currently supports both English and Italian languages, with the flexibility for additional languages to be added based on organizational needs.

==== Changing Language
Language selection is easily accomplished by adding the appropriate language parameter to your Sophia URL. For English interface and responses, append `?lang=en` to your URL, while Italian users should use `?lang=it`. English serves as the default language when no specific language parameter is provided. For example, accessing `https://your-domain.com/sophia?lang=it` will display the entire interface in Italian and configure Sophia to respond in Italian.

==== Language-Specific Features
The multilingual implementation extends throughout the entire user experience. All interface labels, buttons, and navigation elements automatically appear in your selected language, creating a fully localized experience. Sophia intelligently adapts its responses to match the language you use for questions, ensuring natural and culturally appropriate communication. Additionally, all help text, error messages, and system notifications are properly localized to provide consistent language support across every aspect of your interaction.

== Customizing Your Experience

=== Theme Selection

Sophia provides flexible visual customization options through its theme system, allowing users to optimize their interface for different environments and personal preferences.

==== Available Themes
The platform offers two carefully designed themes to enhance user comfort and productivity. The default theme features a sophisticated dark color scheme that's optimized for extended use and reduces eye strain during longer sessions. The light theme provides a bright, clean interface that's ideal for well-lit environments and users who prefer traditional light backgrounds.

==== Changing Themes
Theme customization is achieved through simple URL parameter modification. To activate the dark theme, add `?theme=default` to your URL, while the light theme can be enabled using `?theme=light`. For instance, `https://your-domain.com/sophia?theme=light` will display Sophia using the light theme. These theme changes take effect immediately and persist throughout your session.

=== Display Modes

==== Height Configuration
Sophia offers flexible display height options to accommodate different usage scenarios and integration requirements. The full height mode, activated with `?h=f`, utilizes the complete available screen height to maximize the chat interface area. The auto height mode, enabled through `?h=auto`, intelligently adjusts the interface height based on content requirements, making it ideal for embedded implementations or when space optimization is important.

=== Advanced Features

==== Trim Before Answer (TBA)
This feature removes technical "thinking" tags from responses for cleaner output.

Enable by adding: `?tba=true`

Example: `https://your-domain.com/sophia?tba=true`
