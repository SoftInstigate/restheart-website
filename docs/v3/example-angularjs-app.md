## Web API in action with AngularJS, RESTHeart and MongoDB

Imagine the following scenario: you want to develop a Web application on
top of a data model, following simple CRUD operations. Data can be
modeled as a hierarchy of documents, and MongoDB is a perfect fit for
the job, or you already have some data in a MongoDB instance and you
want to quickly build a user interface for it.

You know that most probably UI requirements will change, and your boss
will ask for a mobile client in the future, so you want to achieve
flexibility by developing a REST API; off course there's no much time
and you must deliver it in few days focusing on the user experience.

You know that a modern MVC javascript framework such as AngularJS can
help you, it can be used to implement the Web interface and populate it
with data using a bunch of AJAX calls to your REST API.

MongoDB will take care of the data, but you still have a missing piece:
the server-side API layer. To implement it there are plenty of choices;
if you are a front-end developer, you probably know JavaScript and
Node.js, with some PHP and Ruby: writing a simple server to expose
MongoDB data following REST principles shouldn't be much hard with such
technologies, right?

You start writing a lot of repetitive logic which is only meant to
create a "bridge" between the database and the UI. Each collection will
need some dedicated server-side logic. After a while you realize you
also need to add authentication, authorization and provide a way to
navigate all data via hyperlinks.

Things are growing in complexity and you are running out of time: "there
must be a better way, I just want to model the data and create a
nice-looking UI, without wasting time with boilerplate code" you think.

Here RESTHeart comes to the rescue!

This tutorial demonstrates a simple but fairly complete RESTful Web
application built using AngularJS and MongoDB, without any server-side
code. This is possible by exposing MongoDB as set of REST services via
RESTHeart, the RESTful API Data Server for MongoDB.

RESTHeart is an open-source project written in Java, distributed under
the same license as MongoDB (GNU AGPL v3.0). It uses internally the
blazing fast Undertow HTTP server, which is at the core of the latest
JBoss Application Server.

The most interesting characteristics of RESTHeart are:

-   Zero development time: just start it and MongoDB documents can be
    exposed via a navigable REST API, ready to use;
-   CRUD Data model operations API for MongoDB: create, read update and
    delete databases, collections, indexes and the data structure
    directly via HTTP;
-   Pluggable security model, with User Management and ACL, so that you
    can expose only the MongoDB resources you really need;
-   HATEOAS HAL hypermedia type, so that it's extremely easy to navigate
    MongoDB resources via URLs only.
-   Extremely lightweight: pipeline architecture, ~7Mb footprint, ~200Mb
    RAM peek usage, starts in milliseconds;
-   Horizontally scalable: stateless architecture supporting MongoDB
    replica sets and shards;
-   Support Cross-origin resource sharing CORS so that your one page Web
    application can deal with RESTHeart running on a different domain.
-   A perfect fit for micro-services deployed in Docker containers.

So, wouldn't be lovely if you could even leverage Docker for development
and deployment? Docker is a cool technology, it allows you to create a
development environment in few minutes and deploy exactly the same stuff
in production. "This would be another huge time-saver!" You think with a
smile.

The Web application we are going to build is a web notepad, where you'll
be able to insert and edit your notes. It will be deployed as a couple
of Docker containers, one running MongoDB and the other running
RESTHeart. Zero server-side code will be written, you need to know only
a little AngularJS for the UI and, of course, some of MongoDB.

## Ingredients

The main ingredients for our recipe are:

-   **MongoDB 3.0** - a cross-platform document-oriented database.
    Classified as a NoSQL database, MongoDB eschews the traditional
    table-based relational database structure in favor of JSON-like
    documents with dynamic schemas.
-   **RESTHeart API Server** - RESTHeart is the RESTful Web API Server
    for MongoDB, ready to use with CRUD operations API and Data Model
    operations API. Create databases, collections, indexes and document
    by only using HTTP verbs.\*\*  
    \*\*
-   **AngularJS** - it lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your
    application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily
    expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
-   **Restangular** - an AngularJS service that simplifies common GET,
    POST, DELETE, and UPDATE requests with a minimum of client code.
    It's a perfect fit for any WebApp that consumes data from a RESTful
    API.
-   **Docker** - Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a
    complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code,
    runtime, system tools, system libraries – anything you can install
    on a server. This guarantees that it will always run the same,
    regardless of the environment it is running in.

## Introduction

RESTHeart is the perfect companion for MongoDB when you want to
effectively expose data CRUD operations via a RESTful Web API, i.e. an
application program interface that relies on Web technologies, notably
the HTTP protocol, to Create, Read, Update and Delete data. With such
API you can easily build a modern Web application, for example
leveraging one of the many MVC JavaScript frameworks such as AngularJS
or Backbone.js.

RESTHeart fully implements HATEOAS principles. HATEOAS, an abbreviation
for Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State, is a constraint of
the REST application architecture. The principle is that a client
interacts with a network application entirely through hypermedia,
provided dynamically by application servers. A REST client needs no
prior knowledge about how to interact with any particular application
beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia.

These are the ingredients for an HATEOAS recipe, where the application
state is held by the client and the server is completely stateless:
a good recipe indeed, that will lead you to serve many concurrent users
with a single node and that can be easily scaled up horizontally. In
this architecture, the data model is effectively represented by a set of
HTTP resources, while the representation logic is managed
entirely client-side by AngularJS.

The following image depicts the client browser with AngularJS connecting
to the Web API, exposed by RESTHeart, that in turns connects to MongoDB.
On the right, a more complex deployment, with MongoDB scaled up in a
shared cluster, and two RESTHeart instances mediated by a load balancer.
The latter configuration is likely to support thousands of concurrent
users.

## Goals

We will create a simple notes Web application.

-   After login, the user will see its notes in a list on the left; a
    search box allows to filter the notes list;
-   Clicking a note in the list, displays it in the content area also
    allowing to edit it;
-   Buttons allow to create a new note or delete an existing one.

## Getting the servers up and running

You can refer to [Installation and
Setup](https://restheart.org/docs/v3/setup/) documentation
section for detailed instructions on how to install RESTHeart and
MongoDB. However, the suggested way to get ready is using the official
[RESTHeart Docker
image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/softinstigate/restheart/).

How to install and use Docker depends on the operating system you are
running:

> In a Docker installation on Linux, your machine is both the localhost
> and the Docker host. In networking, localhost means your computer. The
> Docker host is the machine on which the containers run. On a typical
> Linux installation, the Docker client, the Docker daemon, and any
> containers run directly on your localhost. This means you can address
> ports on a Docker container using standard localhost addressing such
> as localhost:8000 or 0.0.0.0:8376. In a Windows or OSX installation,
> the Docker daemon instead is running inside a Linux virtual machine
> provided by [Boot2Docker](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker).

Full Docker setup instructions are available
at <https://docs.docker.com/installation/>. Please go there and follow
your operating system's instructions if you want to use Docker.

Now, if you Docker setup is terminated, we can proceed.

On Windows and Mac OSX you'll first have to start the Docker virtual
machine host by running `boot2docker`. To run a Docker container, you
first start the boot2docker VM and then issue docker commands to create,
load, and manage containers. You can launch Boot2Docker from your
Applications folder or from the command line. In summary, with
Boot2Docker you have the following additional steps, while if you are on
Linux you don't need them (the `boot2docker init` commando needs to be
issued only the very first time):

**Start boot2docker (only needed in Windows and MacOS X)**

```bash
$ boot2docker init
$ boot2docker start
$ eval "$(boot2docker shellinit)"
```

Boot2Docker will ask you to copy and set some environment variable and
it indicates the `DOCKER_HOST` variable, which is the IP address of the
Docker VM running in your system. Usually it should be something like
`192.168.59.103`, so later you'll point your browser
to `https://192.168.59.103:8080` to access RESTHeart. But let's go on
with our setup for now.

Run the hello-world container to verify your setup:

**Hello, world!**

```plain
$ docker run hello-world
```

If everything looks fine, then you can download the two Docker images
necessary for this tutorial, one for MongoDB and one for RESTHeart.

**Pull the docker images**

```bash
$ docker pull mongo
$ docker pull softinstigate/restheart 
```

The pull commands can take some time to execute, as they are downloading
the Linux images containing all the requisite software.

You can list the available Docker images via the
`docker images` command, which should display something like:

**List local docker images**

```text
$ docker images
 
REPOSITORY                TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
softinstigate/restheart   latest              2e1aaa05d0c5        26 hours ago        496.5 MB
mongo                     latest              a7b01f71af86        2 days ago          260.8 MB
```

Then, you can start MongoDB and RESTHeart containers, in this exact
sequence.

**Start the two images as daemons**

```text
$ docker run -d --name mongodb mongo:3.0
$ docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name restheart --link mongodb:mongodb softinstigate/restheart
```

Without going into the finest detail, the RESTHeart container here is
configured to link to the MongoDB container (for some additional
information on Docker links please have a look to the References section
at the end of this article).

Note that the first command is asking to specifically run the latest
MongoDB 3.0.x release, which at the time of this article is 3.0.4. This
is done by appending the specific Docker tag to the image name
(mongo:3.0 in this case). This is not mandatory but recommended, as
RESTHeart 0.10 now is mainly tested together with MongoDB 3.0, even it
works fine also with versions 2.6 and 2.4.

Docker offers a simple way to access log files and check that everything
is fine, for example issuing the `docker logs mongodb` command:

**MongoDB logs**

```text
$ docker logs mongodb

```

Do the same for RESTHeart, issuing the `docker logs restheart` command:

**RESTHeart logs**

```text
$ docker logs restheart

14:42:13.076 [main] INFO  org.restheart.Bootstrapper - Starting RESTHeart ********************************************

```

The last line shows that RESTHeart has started correctly and is ready to
accept HTTP connections.

Now MongoDB and RESTHeart should be running in background, with
RESTHeart linked to the MongoDB network interface, and you can check
that everything works opening the embedded HAL browser, this way:

If you are running boot2docker, point your browser
at `https://192.168.59.103:8080/browser` (note that the IP address might
be different, to know it issue the `boot2docker ip` command); if you are
on Linux, simply it is at `http://localhost:8080/browser`.

The browser will prompt you for authentication: use the pre-defined
user `admin` with password `changeit`.

Your browser will show you something like this:

![](/images/attachments/7241730/7241791.png)

For more information about the restheart docker image, check it
at [https://hub.docker.com/r/softinstigate/restheart/](https://hub.docker.com/r/softinstigate/restheart/t)

For more information about the RESTHeart security model refer to the
[Security](https://softinstigate.atlassian.net/wiki/display/RH/Security)
documentation section.

## Creating the data structure

We will be using the RESTHeart API and the [HTTPie](https://httpie.org)
(a modern curl replacement) client to create the data structure. The
main reason is that HTTPie offers a beautifully colorized and indented
output for HTTP responses, which is especially useful when dealing with
large JSON payloads.

The following two commands create respectively the `rhedb` database and
the notes collection in it.

**Get up and running**

```bash
$ http -a admin:changeit PUT https://192.168.59.103:8080/rhnedb descr="restheart notes example db"
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
...
$ http -a admin:changeit PUT https://192.168.59.103:8080/rhnedb/notes descr="notes collection"
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
...
```

That's it for the server-side logic; RESTHeart now already automatically
exposes the necessary Web Services for CRUD operations on the notes
collection. Note that we haven't written a single line of server-side
code!

## The Web client

Clone the Web client code from the GitHub's repository at
[https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart-notes-example](https://github.com/softinstigate/restheart-notes-example):

**Clone the Web client**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart-notes-example.git
$ cd restheart-notes-example
```

Depending on how you installed RESTHeart, you might need to adjust the
RESTHEART_URL variable in the code.

Edit the following line in the file app/scripts/app.js

**Set the RESTHEART_URL variable**

```bash
var RESTHEART_URL = "https://192.168.59.103:8080";
```

We assume you are using Docker, so you need to set it with the IP
address of the RESTHeart container; it might be the `localhost`; if you
are using boot2docker, you can retrieve the IP with the following
command:

**Get the IP address**

```bash
$ boot2docker ip
```

To run the application, first of all you have to install Node.js.
Download the installer for your system
from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

The following commands will update npm, install
the [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/getting-started) and [Bower](https://bower.io/) tools,
download the required js libraries using bower and start a web server
for previewing the application .

**View the web app**

```bash
$ npm update -g npm
$ npm install -g bower grunt-cli
$ bower install
 (If Bower asks you for the AngularJS version, choose 1.3.0)
$ grunt serve
 (after a while it should starts the default browser at http://localhost:9000/#/signin)
```

## Understanding the Web client

The Web client is an AngularJS application, a javascript client that
connects with RESTHeart API to manage data.

The application skeleton has been generated with
[Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) using the AngularJS generator with few
libraries added via bower, notably:

-   [Restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular), an AngularJS
    service "to handle Rest API Restful Resources properly and easily";
-   [angular-local-storage](https://github.com/grevory/angular-local-storage) "an
    AngularJS module that gives you access to the browsers local storage
    with cookie fallback";
-   [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router), "the de-facto
    solution to flexible routing with nested views in AngularJS".

In order to understand how it works, we need to look at the following
files:

-   app/scripts/app.js
-   app/scripts/config.router.js
-   app/scripts/controllers/main.js
-   app/scripts/controllers/signin.js
-   app/scripts/controllers/notes.js

### Application initialization and configuration

These tasks are accomplished by:

-   **app.js** that defines the AngularJS application and configure
    Restangular to properly interoperate with RESTHeart;
-   **config.router.js** that defines the ui-router states with their
    html templates and controllers.

The following code snippet from config.router.js shows the three states
of the application: _signin_, the abstract state _app_ and _app.notes_.

**application states**

```plain
                     .state('signin', {
                            url: '/signin',
                            templateUrl: 'views/signin.html',
                            controller: 'SigninCtrl',
                            resolve: {
                                deps: ['$ocLazyLoad',
                                    function ($ocLazyLoad) {
                                        return $ocLazyLoad.load('scripts/controllers/signin.js');
                                    }
                                ]
                            }
                        })

                        .state('app', {
                            template: '<div ui-view></div>',
                            abstract: true,
                            controller: 'MainCtrl',
                            resolve: {
                                deps: ['$ocLazyLoad',
                                    function ($ocLazyLoad) {
                                        return $ocLazyLoad.load('scripts/controllers/main.js');
                                    }
                                ]
                            }
                        })

                        .state('app.notes', {
                            url: "/notes",
                            templateUrl: 'views/notes.html',
                            controller: 'NotesCtrl',
                            resolve: {
                                deps: ['$ocLazyLoad',
                                    function ($ocLazyLoad) {
                                        return $ocLazyLoad.load('scripts/controllers/notes.js');
                                    }
                                ]
                            }
                        });
```

### Authentication

The _signin_ state is where user authentication occurs. A form collects
the user id and the password and perform a GET request to RESTHeart at
the URI `/_logic/roles/<userid>`; this is a special endpoint intended to
simplify the credentials check process.

The possible responses to GET `/_logic/roles/<userid>` requests are:

-   _401 Unauthorized_, if no or wrong credentials were passed in the
    Authorization header
-   _403 Forbidden_, if the user id in the Authorization header is
    different than the &lt;userid&gt; in the URI
-   _200 OK_ if credentials match; in this case the following document
    is sent; not that it includes the _roles_ array:  


**Roles**

```json
{
    "_embedded": {},
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "/_logic/roles/admin"
        }
    },
    "authenticated": true,
    "roles": ["ADMIN"]
}
```

If any request gets successfully authenticated RESTHeart includes in the
response the following headers:

-   `Auth-Token: 6a81d622-5e24-4d9e-adc0-e3f7f2d93ac7`
-   `Auth-Token-Location: /_authtokens/admin`
-   `Auth-Token-Valid-Until: 2015-07-08T13:28:10.749Z`

The **Authentication Token** is a very important feature when you are
developing a Web application. RESTHeart uses stateless basic
authentication, so every request needs to include the user credentials;
you need to store them either in a cookie or (better) in the session
storage. In order to avoid to store the actual password, the client can
check the credentials and, if they are verified, it can rather store the
auth token and use it on further requests.

In summary, The authentication token together with the
`/_logic/roles/<userid>` resource, allows you to implement a form based
authentication experience on top of the simple and effective basic
authentication mechanism; this is actually what the signin.js controller
does:

It GETs /\_logic/roles/ and in case it gets back 200, it stores the
authentication token in the session storage.

Restangular is then configured to:

-   always add the basic authentication header to every further requests
-   to delete the auth token from the session storage if it is expired
    leading to a *401 Unauthorized* response
-   to add the *No-Auth-Challenge* request header to avoid the browser
    to prompt you for credentials with the awful popup login window

Finally, the controller of the app abstract state (that is executed by
all children states, including app.notes) checks if the authentication
token has been stored in the session storage, eventually redirecting to
the sign-in page.

### Getting, Posting, and Deleting Notes

Most of the application logic is handled by the controller notes.js of
the app.notes state.

reference sheet

Have a look at the RESTHeart documentation [reference
sheet](https://restheart.org/docs/v3/quick-reference)to quickly
understand the semantic of the HTTP verbs on the different resources
(for instance, a POST to a collection URI creates a document in it).

#### Notes list

The interface shows the list of existing notes on the left column, also
allowing to filter it based on a search query. This is done by the
loadNotes function:

**Load notes**

```js
$scope.loadNotes = function (selectFirst) {
    $scope.isLoading = true;
    var apiOptions = {
        pagesize: 50,
        page: 1,
        count: true,
        sort_by: "-date"
    };
    var filter = getFilter($scope.query);
    if (angular.isDefined(filter)) {
        apiOptions.filter = filter;
    }
    ApiRestangular.all('notes').getList(apiOptions).then(function (result) {
        $scope.notes = result;
        $scope.isLoading = false;
        if (angular.isDefined(selectFirst) && selectFirst) {
            $scope.selected = $scope.notes[0];
        }
    });
};
$scope.$watch('query', function (newValue, oldValue) {
    $scope.loadNotes();
}, true);
 
....
 
function getFilter(query, userid) {
    if (angular.isDefined(query)) {
        return {'$and': [{'user': userid}, {'content': {$regex: '.*' + query + '.*' }}]};
    } else {
        return {'user': userid};
    }
}
```

The Restangular getList() call performs the following request:

    GET /rhnedb/notes?sort_by=-date&filter={'user':'<userid>'}&pagesize=50&page=1

And, in case a search query has been specified:

    GET /rhnedb/notes?sort_by=-date&filter={'$and':[{'user':'<userid>'},{'content':{'$regex':'(?i).*THE_QUERY_STRING.*'}}]}&pagesize=50&page=1

These GET requests to the URI `/rhnedb/notes` return the properties of
the collection itself together with its documents in the \_embedded
sub-document according to the HAL representation format used by
RESTHeart.

The query parameters influence the result set:

-   **sort_by** requires the documents to be sorted: in this case, by
    the _date_ property descending (- stands for descending);
-   **pagesize** and **page** control the paging: in this case we are
    returning the first 50 documents;
-   **filter** can be any MongoDB query: in this case, it filters the
    notes limiting to those created by the authenticated user; also, if
    a search query has been specified, the *\$regex* operator performs a
    case-insensitive match for documents with _content_ value containing
    it.

#### Creating a new note

The new button allows to create a new note. This is done by the
`createNote()` function:

**Create a new note**

```js
$scope.createNote = function () {
    var note = {
        content: 'New note',
        color: $scope.colors[Math.floor(Math.random() * 3)],
        date: Date.now(),
        user: AuthService.getSavedUserid(),
    };
    ApiRestangular.all('notes')
        .post(note)
        .then(function () {
            $scope.loadNotes();
        });
};
```

The Restangular post() performs the following request:

    POST /rhnedb/notes <data.json>

POSTing the collection creates a new document; as soon as the response
is received, the notes list gets reloaded (now it includes the new note
as first item due to the sorting on the date property).

#### Updating and Deleting a note

When a note is selected, it gets displayed in the textarea on the right.
As soon as the user modifies it, the note gets marked as "dirty" and the
Save button is displayed. Clicking it invokes the updateNote() function:

**Update a note**

```js
$scope.updateNote = function () {
    if (angular.isUndefined($scope.selected)) {
        return;
    }
    $scope.selected.date = Date.now();
    $scope.selected
        .put(null, { 'If-Match': $scope.selected._etag.$oid })
        .then(function (res) {
            dirties[$scope.selected._id.$oid] = false;
            $scope.loadNotes(true);
        });
};
$scope.deleteNote = function () {
    ApiRestangular.one('notes', $scope.selected._id.$oid)
        .remove(null, { 'If-Match': $scope.selected._etag.$oid })
        .then(function () {
            $scope.loadNotes();
            $scope.selected = null;
        });
};
```

The Restangular `put()` performs the following request:

    PUT /rhnedb/notes/<noteid> <data.json>

Note the argument {"If-Match": $scope.selected.\_etag.$oid}

This adds the If-Match request header with the values of the note
property \_etag.\$oid. RESTHeart implements the Entity Tag optimistic
concurrency control protocol: existing resources can be modified only
specifying the correct ETag in this header, otherwise 409 Conflict or
412 Precondition Failed return error codes are returned. This makes sure
that clients do not modify a resource that has been already modified by
another client, leading to the so called ghost writes. More information
on [ETag](https://softinstigate.atlassian.net/wiki/x/hICM) documentation
section.

The "Delete" button allows to delete the selected note.

The Restangular remove() performs the following request:

    DELETE /rhnedb/notes/<noteid>

Of course, the `If-Match` header needs to be added to DELETE requests as
well.

As soon as the Restangular promise gets fulfilled, the notes list is
reloaded (see the argument of the function then()).

## Stopping and restarting

You should always stop RESTHeart **before** MongoDB. If you are running
Docker:

**Stop Docker containers**

```text
$ docker stop restheart
$ docker stop mongodb
```

You should start MongoDB **before** RESTHeart. You can decide to delete
and recreate the Docker containers. If you delete and re-create the
MongoDB container then all data will be lost. If you want to prevent
this, then you can start it again:

**Start an existing Docker container**

```text
$ docker start mongodb
```

On the other hand, RESTHeart is fully stateless, so it's recommended to
**always remove and re-create the RESTHeart container** from scratch.

**Remove and re-run a Docker container**

```text
$ docker rm restheart
$ docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name restheart --link mongodb:mongodb softinstigate/restheart
```

## Conclusions

We built a nice Web application, using some interesting technologies:
Docker, Yeoman, AngularJS and Restangular to name few and MongoDB and
RESTHeart of course.

We shown how to install a development environment and we described how
the AngularJS Web application is organized looking at how the
controllers interoperate with the server using the Restangular service.

We spent little time on MongoDB and RESTHeart and this poses us a
question: why this application requires zero effort for server side
development still providing a robust and scalable implementation?

The answer relies on the architecture that builds on top of the MongoDB
schemaless, NoSQL database and its companion RESTHeart: in fact, from a
development prospective, RESTHeart is not yet another way
of implementing Web APIs, rather it connects to MongoDB and
automatically exposes data model APIs (to create databases, collections,
indexes, etc) and data API (to create, get, update and delete
documents); thus there is no need for any server side development.

Of course, a real case enterprise application needs more than what we
have shown in this post: fine grained access control, user base
management, relationship management, the ability to inject server side
business logic, resource representation transformations, and schema
check and enforcement, to name few. Notably, RESTHeart provides all
these features, leading to cut down development costs but still
achieving enterprise grade quality in terms of robustness, scalability
and maintainability.

At SoftInstigate, the company behind RESTHeart, we have developed
complex Web applications based on RESTHeart, and after years of
struggling with ever complicating application servers, we having proved
on the ground that developing with the HATEOAS tools can make
development funny again.
