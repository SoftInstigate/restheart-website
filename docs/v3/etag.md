## Introduction

The **ETag** or **entity tag** is part of HTTP; it is used for:

-   **[Web cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cache) validation**,
    and which allows a client to make conditional requests. This allows
    caches to be more efficient, and saves bandwidth, as a web server
    does not need to send a full response if the content has not
    changed. 
-   For **[optimistic concurrency
    control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control)** as
    a way to help prevent ghost writes, i.e. simultaneous updates of a
    resource from overwriting each other.

RESTHeart automatically manages ETags, creating and updating them.

For example, let's create a database, a collection and a document. You
can note that any response includes the header ETag (other response
headers are omitted for simplicity) and this is valid for any type of
resource, included file resources.

``` bash
PUT /test descr="a db for testing"
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
...
ETag: 55e84b95c2e66d1e0a8e46b2

PUT /test/coll descr="a collection for testing"
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
...
ETag: 55e84be2c2e66d1e0a8e46b3
 
PUT /test/coll/doc descr="a document for testing"
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
...
ETag: 55e84c0ac2e66d1e0a8e46b4
 
GET /test/coll/doc
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
ETag: 55e84c0ac2e66d1e0a8e46b4
... (data follows)
```

## ETag for write requests

Starting version 2.0 the checking policy is configurable and the default
policy only requires the ETag for DELETE /db and DELETE /db/collection
requests.

Previous versions always require the ETag to be specified for any write
request.

Let's try to update the document at URI /test/coll/doc forcing the ETag
check with the `checkEtag` query parameter.

``` bash
PUT 127.0.0.1:8080/test/coll/doc?checkEtag  { "descry": "a document for testing but modified" }
HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
...
ETag: 55e84c0ac2e66d1e0a8e46b4
```

RESTHeart send back the error message *409 Conflict*, showing that the
document has not been updated.

Note that the *ETag* header is present in the response. 

Let's try to pass now a wrong ETag via the *If-Match* request header

``` bash
PUT 127.0.0.1:8080/test/coll/doccheckEtag descr="a document for testing but modified" If-Match:wrong_etag
HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed
...
ETag: 55e84c0ac2e66d1e0a8e46b4
```

RESTHeart send back the error message *412 Precondition Failed*, showing
that the document has not been updated.

Again the correct ETag header is present in the response. 

Let's try to pass now the correct ETag via the *If-Match* request header

``` bash
PUT /test/coll/doc?checkEtag descr="a document for testing but modified" If-Match:55e84c0ac2e66d1e0a8e46b4
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
ETag: 55e84f5ac2e66d1e0a8e46b8
```

Yes, updated! And the response includes the new ETag value.

## ETag for web caching

The responses of GET requests on document and file resources always
include the ETag header.

The ETag is used by browsers for caching: after the first data
retrieval, the browser will send further requests with *If-None-Match*
request header. In case the resource state has not been modified
(leading to a change in the ETag value), the response will be just *304
Not Modified*, without passing back the data and thus saving bandwidth.
This is especially useful for file resources.

``` bash
$ http -a a:a GET 127.0.0.1:8080/test/coll/doc
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
ETag: 55e84c0ac2e66d1e0a8e46b4
... (data follows)
 
$ http -a a:a GET 127.0.0.1:8080/test/coll/doc If-None-Match:55e84c0ac2e66d1e0a8e46b4
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
```

## ETag policy

RESTHeart has a default configurable ETag checking policy.

The following configuration file snippet defines the default ETag check
policy:

-   The policy applies for databases, collections (also applies to file
    buckets) and documents.
-   valid values are REQUIRED, REQUIRED\_FOR\_DELETE, OPTIONAL

It defines when the ETag check is mandatory.

``` yml
etag-check-policy:
   db: REQUIRED_FOR_DELETE
   coll: REQUIRED_FOR_DELETE
   doc: OPTIONAL
```

The ETag checking policy can also be modified at request level with the
`checkETag` query parameter and at db or collection level using the
`etagPolicy` and `etagDocPolicy` metadata.

For instance specifying the following collection metadata, the ETag will
be checked for all write requests on the collection resources and its
documents.

``` plain
{
  "etagPolicy": "REQUIRED",
  "etagDocPolicy": "REQUIRED"
}
```

An interesting usage of the *checkETag* query parameter is avoiding the
upsert semantic of RESTHeart.

If the client wants to make sure that a write request only creates
documents without updating them, it can send a random ETag; in case the
resource does not exist, the ETag is not checked anyway.

``` plain
PUT /db/coll/doc?checkEtag If-Match:x
```

 

This request leads either to CREATED if the document with id *doc* was
not existing or to PRECONDITION FAILED if it already exists.

## An example with AngularJs

The example project
[restheart-notes-example](https://github.com/softinstigate/restheart-notes-example) on
github uses AngularJs to interact with RESTHeart.

It allows to create and edit notes.

The following is a snippet the controller
[notes.js ](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart-notes-example/blob/master/app/scripts/controllers/notes.js)

``` js
$scope.updateNote = function () {
   if (angular.isUndefined($scope.selected)) {
      return;
   }
   $scope.selected.date = {"$date": Date.now() };
   $scope.selected.put(null, {"If-Match": $scope.selected._etag.$oid}).then(function (res) {
      delete dirties[$scope.selected._id.$oid];
      $scope.loadNotes(true);
   });
};
```

The $scope.selected.put() call passes the *If-Match* header and, as soon
as the promise is resolved, it reloads the notes calling
$scope.loadNotes() thus refreshing also the ETags hold by the client.

If a client tries to update a note already changed by a concurrent user,
it gets back the *412 Precondition Failed* error message. This is the
ETag based optimistic concurrency control in action.
