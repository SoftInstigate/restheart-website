## Introduction

In this tutorial we use RESTHeart to create a **database**, a **collection** and a couple of **documents** in MongoDB. Then we show how to perform simple queries. Here we use **Docker** because it's the easiest way to run RESTHeart and MongoDB together.

> We useÂ [httpie](https://httpie.org/), a command line HTTP client ([curl](https://curl.haxx.se) is fine, but httpie is easier to use and produces a colorized and formatted output that's easier to read). For a primer read [httpie: A CLI http client that will make you smile](http://radek.io/2015/10/20/httpie/).

## Start MongoDB and RESTHeart

If you have Docker properly installed in your machine, you can start RESTHeart in seconds:

``` bash
$ mkdir restheart && cd restheart
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/master/docker-compose.yml --output docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up -d
```

That runs RESTHeart and an empty MongoDB container, which we are going to use for the rest of this tutorial.

Optionally, you might want to review to the [setup](/docs/v3/setup/#run-restheart-with-docker) section to get more details on how to run RESTHeart and MongoDB with Docker and Docker Compose, but you can leave it for later. Let's instead jump into some action.

## Create a Database

Now that RESTHeart is up and running and connected to its empty MongoDB instance (just created for you by Docker Compose), the first step is to create a new MongoDB database:

``` bash
$ http -a 'admin:changeit' PUT localhost:8080/db desc='this is my first db created with restheart'

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ETag, Auth-Token, Auth-Token-Valid-Until, Auth-Token-Location, X-Powered-By
Auth-Token: 65iz1g89ao5r2e47whohfx6ffw6vfl6nf6d44nyxez0ri7yzzh
Auth-Token-Location: /_authtokens/admin
Auth-Token-Valid-Until: 2018-04-26T14:09:29.385Z
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Thu, 26 Apr 2018 13:54:29 GMT
ETag: 5ae1da15a7b11b0005a3c41d
X-Powered-By: restheart.org
```

## Get the database

To get the created database:

``` bash
$ http -a 'admin:changeit' GET localhost:8080/db

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ETag, Auth-Token, Auth-Token-Valid-Until, Auth-Token-Location, X-Powered-By
Auth-Token: 65iz1g89ao5r2e47whohfx6ffw6vfl6nf6d44nyxez0ri7yzzh
Auth-Token-Location: /_authtokens/admin
Auth-Token-Valid-Until: 2018-04-26T14:19:07.744Z
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Length: 149
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Thu, 26 Apr 2018 14:04:07 GMT
ETag: 5ae1da15a7b11b0005a3c41d
X-Powered-By: restheart.org
```
```json
{
    "_embedded": [], 
    "_etag": {
        "$oid": "5ae1da15a7b11b0005a3c41d"
    }, 
    "_id": "db", 
    "_returned": 0, 
    "_size": 0, 
    "_total_pages": 0, 
    "desc": "this is my first db created with restheart"
}
```

## Create a Collection

Now it's possible to create a collection "coll" in the database "db":

``` bash
$ http -a 'admin:changeit' PUT localhost:8080/db/coll desc='my first collection created with restheart'

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ETag, Auth-Token, Auth-Token-Valid-Until, Auth-Token-Location, X-Powered-By
Auth-Token: 65iz1g89ao5r2e47whohfx6ffw6vfl6nf6d44nyxez0ri7yzzh
Auth-Token-Location: /_authtokens/admin
Auth-Token-Valid-Until: 2018-04-26T14:25:39.914Z
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Thu, 26 Apr 2018 14:10:39 GMT
ETag: 5ae1dddfa7b11b0005a3c41f
X-Powered-By: restheart.org
```

## Get the collection

To get the created collection:

``` bash
$ http -a 'admin:changeit' GET 127.0.0.1:8080/db/coll

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ETag, Auth-Token, Auth-Token-Valid-Until, Auth-Token-Location, X-Powered-By
Auth-Token: 65iz1g89ao5r2e47whohfx6ffw6vfl6nf6d44nyxez0ri7yzzh
Auth-Token-Location: /_authtokens/admin
Auth-Token-Valid-Until: 2018-04-26T14:26:43.480Z
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Length: 135
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Thu, 26 Apr 2018 14:11:43 GMT
ETag: 5ae1dddfa7b11b0005a3c41f
X-Powered-By: restheart.org
```
``` json
{
    "_embedded": [], 
    "_etag": {
        "$oid": "5ae1dddfa7b11b0005a3c41f"
    }, 
    "_id": "coll", 
    "_returned": 0, 
    "desc": "my first collection created with restheart"
}

```

## Create two Documents

Let's create some documents in MongoDB.

### First document

``` bash
$ http -a 'admin:changeit' POST localhost:8080/db/coll name='RESTHeart' rating='cool'

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ETag, Auth-Token, Auth-Token-Valid-Until, Auth-Token-Location, X-Powered-By
Auth-Token: 65iz1g89ao5r2e47whohfx6ffw6vfl6nf6d44nyxez0ri7yzzh
Auth-Token-Location: /_authtokens/admin
Auth-Token-Valid-Until: 2018-04-26T14:28:06.435Z
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Thu, 26 Apr 2018 14:13:06 GMT
ETag: 5ae1de72a7b11b0005a3c420
Location: http://localhost:8080/db/coll/5ae1de72586f80fc867131f4
X-Powered-By: restheart.org
```

Note the `Location` header, as it contains a link to the newly created document! To get the document you can directly copy that link and use it in a subsequent query, like this:

``` bash
$ http -a 'admin:changeit' GET http://localhost:8080/db/coll/5ae1de72586f80fc867131f4

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ETag, Auth-Token, Auth-Token-Valid-Until, Auth-Token-Location, X-Powered-By
Auth-Token: 65iz1g89ao5r2e47whohfx6ffw6vfl6nf6d44nyxez0ri7yzzh
Auth-Token-Location: /_authtokens/admin
Auth-Token-Valid-Until: 2018-04-26T14:38:48.212Z
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Length: 119
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Thu, 26 Apr 2018 14:23:48 GMT
ETag: 5ae1de72a7b11b0005a3c420
X-Powered-By: restheart.org
```
``` json
{
    "_etag": {
        "$oid": "5ae1de72a7b11b0005a3c420"
    }, 
    "_id": {
        "$oid": "5ae1de72586f80fc867131f4"
    }, 
    "name": "RESTHeart", 
    "rating": "cool"
}
```

### Second document

Cool, now let's create a second document:

``` bash
$ http -a 'admin:changeit' POST localhost:8080/db/coll name='MongoDB' rating='super cool'

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ETag, Auth-Token, Auth-Token-Valid-Until, Auth-Token-Location, X-Powered-By
Auth-Token: 65iz1g89ao5r2e47whohfx6ffw6vfl6nf6d44nyxez0ri7yzzh
Auth-Token-Location: /_authtokens/admin
Auth-Token-Valid-Until: 2018-04-26T14:29:24.215Z
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Thu, 26 Apr 2018 14:14:24 GMT
ETag: 5ae1dec0a7b11b0005a3c421
Location: http://localhost:8080/db/coll/5ae1dec0586f80fc86713200
X-Powered-By: restheart.org
```

As before, note the `Location` header. As before, you can GET the newly created document by requesting that link.

## Get all Documents from the Collection

Now let's get all documents in a row. For this, we send a GET request to the whole collection (named "coll" in this example).

```bash
$ http -a 'admin:changeit' GET localhost:8080/db/coll

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ETag, Auth-Token, Auth-Token-Valid-Until, Auth-Token-Location, X-Powered-By
Auth-Token: 65iz1g89ao5r2e47whohfx6ffw6vfl6nf6d44nyxez0ri7yzzh
Auth-Token-Location: /_authtokens/admin
Auth-Token-Valid-Until: 2018-04-26T14:30:18.109Z
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Length: 223
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Thu, 26 Apr 2018 14:15:18 GMT
ETag: 5ae1dddfa7b11b0005a3c41f
X-Powered-By: restheart.org
```
```json
{
    "_embedded": [
        {
            "_etag": {
                "$oid": "5ae1dec0a7b11b0005a3c421"
            }, 
            "_id": {
                "$oid": "5ae1dec0586f80fc86713200"
            }, 
            "name": "MongoDB", 
            "rating": "super cool"
        }, 
        {
            "_etag": {
                "$oid": "5ae1de72a7b11b0005a3c420"
            }, 
            "_id": {
                "$oid": "5ae1de72586f80fc867131f4"
            }, 
            "name": "RESTHeart", 
            "rating": "cool"
        }
    ], 
    "_etag": {
        "$oid": "5ae1dddfa7b11b0005a3c41f"
    }, 
    "_id": "coll", 
    "_returned": 2, 
    "desc": "my first collection created with restheart"
}
```

Note that the two documents are within the `_embedded` array, while the rest is metadata (the meaning of metadata, such as `_etag` and `_returned`, should appear self-explanatory).

Also beware that RESTHeart applies a [pagination algorithm](/docs/v3/query-documents/#paging) to all requests, but by default it works only if the collection contains more than 100 documents, which is not this case.

## GET Document by URL (by id)

If you look into the `_embedded` array and copy the `_id` element, then it's possible to get that single document directly, exactly as we did before by looking at the `Location` header

For example, let's say the `_id` of a document in the `_embedded` array is "5ae1de72586f80fc867131f4" then we can GET it immediately:

``` bash
$ http -a 'admin:changeit' GET localhost:8080/db/coll/5ae1de72586f80fc867131f4

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ETag, Auth-Token, Auth-Token-Valid-Until, Auth-Token-Location, X-Powered-By
Auth-Token: 65iz1g89ao5r2e47whohfx6ffw6vfl6nf6d44nyxez0ri7yzzh
Auth-Token-Location: /_authtokens/admin
Auth-Token-Valid-Until: 2018-04-26T14:35:42.549Z
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Length: 119
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Thu, 26 Apr 2018 14:20:42 GMT
ETag: 5ae1de72a7b11b0005a3c420
X-Powered-By: restheart.org
```
```json
{
    "_etag": {
        "$oid": "5ae1de72a7b11b0005a3c420"
    }, 
    "_id": {
        "$oid": "5ae1de72586f80fc867131f4"
    }, 
    "name": "RESTHeart", 
    "rating": "cool"
}

```

## Query documents by properties

Using directly the document `_id` is of course not the only available option. We can actually leverage MongoDB queries with the `filter` query parameter in HTTP calls:

``` bash
$ http -a 'admin:changeit' GET localhost:8080/db/coll?filter="{'name':'MongoDB'}"

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ETag, Auth-Token, Auth-Token-Valid-Until, Auth-Token-Location, X-Powered-By
Auth-Token: 65iz1g89ao5r2e47whohfx6ffw6vfl6nf6d44nyxez0ri7yzzh
Auth-Token-Location: /_authtokens/admin
Auth-Token-Valid-Until: 2018-04-26T14:44:29.115Z
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Length: 192
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Thu, 26 Apr 2018 14:29:29 GMT
ETag: 5ae1dddfa7b11b0005a3c41f
X-Powered-By: restheart.org
```
```json
{
    "_embedded": [
        {
            "_etag": {
                "$oid": "5ae1dec0a7b11b0005a3c421"
            }, 
            "_id": {
                "$oid": "5ae1dec0586f80fc86713200"
            }, 
            "name": "MongoDB", 
            "rating": "super cool"
        }
    ], 
    "_etag": {
        "$oid": "5ae1dddfa7b11b0005a3c41f"
    }, 
    "_id": "coll", 
    "_returned": 1, 
    "desc": "my first collection created with restheart"
}
```

Now you could jump to [Queries](/docs/v3/query-documents/) for more complex examples on how to search documents. Remember that you will have all MongoDB's queries power at your disposal.

## Clean-up

To stop all containers and clean-up everything, just run the `docker-compose down -v` command:

``` bash
$ docker-compose down -v

Stopping restheart       ... done
Stopping restheart-mongo ... done
Removing restheart       ... done
Removing restheart-mongo ... done
Removing network restheart_backend
Removing volume restheart_restheart-datadb
```
