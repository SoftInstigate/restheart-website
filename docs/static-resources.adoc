RESTHeart allows serving static resources acting as a Web Server.

An example configuration follows:

#### Static Web Resources

# Static web resources to bind to the URL specified by the 'where' property.
# The 'what' property is the path of the directory containing the resources.
# The path is either absolute (starts with /) or relative to the restheart.jar file
# Set embedded: true, if resources are embedded in the file restheart.jar

static-resources:
  - what: /data/www
    where: /static
    welcome-file: index.html
    embedded: false
