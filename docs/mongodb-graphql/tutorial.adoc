:page-liquid:

This tutorial guides you through the process of implementing a GraphQL API using RESTHeart, following the structure and concepts presented in the link:https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#type-system[GraphQL.org tutorial]  on Star Wars characters and episodes, demonstrating the implementation using RESTHeart.

Dive into the world of GraphQL and RESTHeart, and may the force be with your data!

NOTE: While this tutorial provides buttons for executing requests using "Rest Ninja," please be aware that it may not seamlessly function with Safari due to HTTPS requirements. For a smoother experience, we recommend using Chrome or Firefox browsers (refer to [Configure TLS](link:/docs/security/tls/)).

== Create the Star Wars GraphQL API

IMPORTANT: This tutorial requires RESTHeart v7.6.4+

NOTE: You won't write a single line of code! The GraphQL API just requires to define a json configuration, known as GraphQL App Definition and store it in the special collection `/gql-apps`.

**1 Start RESTHeart and MongoDB**

The following one-liner uses docker compose to start both RESTHeart and MongoDb. If you prefer not using docker, please refer to link:/docs/setup[setup] section to install RESTHeart and MongoDB.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/master/docker-compose.yml --output docker-compose.yml && docker compose up
----

**2 Create collections**

Create the *star-wars-characters* collection. This is where the data will be inserted.

++++
{% include code-header.html
    type="Request"
    link="https://restninja.io/share/36f1499c310f74ec7092e47e488666c69abf45f5/0"
%}
++++

[source,http]
PUT /star-wars-characters HTTP/1.1

Create the *gql-apps* collection. This is where the GraphQL App definition will be inserted.

++++
{% include code-header.html
    type="Request"
    link="https://restninja.io/share/cf0d3d9a0f811cf5d6921ad66fcf49cbad852a5a/0"
%}
++++

[source, http]
PUT /gql-apps HTTP/1.1

**3 Insert data**

Create documents in the *star-wars-characters* collection:

++++
{% include code-header.html
    type="Request"
    link="https://restninja.io/share/1dd617582b894304fe3968dc2c97feff08c0adcb/1"
%}
++++

[source,http]
----
POST /star-wars-characters?wm=upsert HTTP/1.1
----

[.text-muted]
*Request body*
[source,json]
----
[
    {"_id":1000,"name":"Luke Skywalker","friends":[1002,1003,2000,2001],"appearsIn":[4,5,6],"homePlanet":"Tatooine","heroOf":4},
    {"_id":1001,"name":"Darth Vader","friends":[1004],"appearsIn":[4,5,6],"homePlanet":"Tatooine","heroOf":5},

    {"_id":1003,"name":"Leia Organa","friends":[1000,1002,2000,2001],"appearsIn":[4,5,6],"homePlanet":"Alderaan"},
    {"_id":1004,"name":"Wilhuff Tarkin","friends":[1001],"appearsIn":[4],"homePlanet":"Eriadu"},{"_id":2000,"name":"C-3PO","friends":[1000,1002,1003,2001],"appearsIn":[4,5,6],"primaryFunction":"Protocol"},
    {"_id":2001,"name":"R2-D2","friends":[1000,1002,1003],"appearsIn":[4,5,6],"primaryFunction":"Astromech","heroOf":6},
    {"_id":3000,"name":"TIE Advanced x1","length":9.2}
]
----

**4 Insert the GraphQL App Definition**

To insert the GraphQL app definition, run the following:

++++
{% include code-header.html
    type="Request"
    link="https://restninja.io/share/8d48b4efb6c042ea3ae6fff72823d42356494514/0"
%}
++++

[source,http]
----
POST /gql-apps?wm=upsert HTTP/1.1
----

NOTE: Request body omitted because is quite long. Find it in the link:#the-full-graphql-app-definition[The full GraphQL APP definition] section.

[.mt-4]
.That's it

                },

            ],

}

NOTE: Please note that the response content-type is `application/graphql-response+json`. It is treated as a binary format by RestNinja, which results in a less user-friendly display. To circumvent this issue and view the response more effectively, you can opt to use HTTPie, a command-line HTTP client:

[source,bash]
$ echo '{ hero(episode: JEDI) { name friends { name } ... on Droid { primaryFunction } ... on Human { homePlanet } } }' | http -a admin:secret :8080/graphql/star-wars Content-Type:application/graphql

== Understanding the GraphQL App Definition

GraphQL types are connected to MongoDB data through mappings.

NOTE: If you donâ€™t explicitly define a mapping for a field, RESTHeart will automatically map it to the MongoDB document field with the same name.

=== enum Episode

The GraphQL schema defines the enum `Episode`:

[source,graphql]
----
enum Episode { NEWHOPE EMPIRE JEDI }
----

The enum type requires a mapping unless the value in the database is identical to the string representation of the enum value. If you look at the data, the episode are stored with Int codes. Thus we need a mapping to link the Int codes to the enum values.

TIP: for more information on enum mappings see link:/docs/mongodb-graphql/graphql-apps#enum-mappings[Enum mappings]

[source,json]
----
{
    "mappings": {
        "Episode": { "NEWHOPE": 4, "EMPIRE": 5, "JEDI": 6 }
    }
}
----

=== union SearchResult

The GraphQL schema defines the union `SearchResult`:

[source,graphql]
----
union SearchResult = Human | Droid | Starship
----

The union requires a `$typeResolver`

TIP: for more information on union mappings see link:/docs/mongodb-graphql/graphql-apps#union-mappings[Union Mappings]

[source,json]
----
{
    "mappings": {
        "SearchResult": {
            "$typeResolver": {
                "Human": "field-exists(homePlanet)",
                "Droid": "field-exists(primaryFunction)",
                "Starship": "field-exists(length)"
            }
        }
    }
}
----

=== interface Character

The GraphQL schema defines the interface `Character`:

[source,graphql]
----
interface Character {
  _id: Int!
  name: String!
  friends: [Character]!
  appearsIn: [Episode]!
}
----

The interface requires a `$typeResolver`

TIP: for more information on interface mappings see link:/docs/mongodb-graphql/graphql-apps#interface-mappings[Interface Mappings]

[source,json]
----
{
    "mappings": {
        "Character": {
            "$typeResolver": {
                "Human": "field-exists(homePlanet)",
                "Droid": "field-exists(primaryFunction)"
            }
        }
    }
}
----

=== object Starship

The GraphQL schema defines the object type `Starship`:

[source,graphql]
----
type Starship {
  _id: Int!
  name: String!
  length(unit: LengthUnit = METER): Float
}
----

No mapping is required since default field-to-field mappings are fine

TIP: for more information on field-to-field mappings see link:/docs/mongodb-graphql/graphql-apps#field-to-field-mapping[Field-to-field mapping]

=== objects Human and Droid

The GraphQL schema defines the object types `Human` and `Droids`:

[source,graphql]
----
type Human implements Character {
  _id: Int!
  name: String!
  friends: [Character]!
  appearsIn: [Episode]!
  homePlanet: String!
}

type Droid implements Character {
  _id: Int!
  name: String!
  friends: [Character]!
  appearsIn: [Episode]!
  primaryFunction: String!
}
----

Those object types have the field `friends` in common, actually derived by the fact that they both implement the interface `Character`. This field requires a field-to-query mapping.

TIP: for more information on field-to-query mappings see link:/docs/mongodb-graphql/graphql-apps#field-to-query-mapping[Field-to-query Mapping]

TIP: for more information on the `$fk` operator see link:/docs/mongodb-graphql/graphql-apps#mappings-operators[Mapping Operators]

[source,json]
----
{
    "mappings": {
        "Human": {
            "friends": {
                "db": "restheart",
                "collection": "star-wars-characters",
                "find": { "_id": { "$in": { "$fk": "friends" } } }
            }
        },
        "Droid": {
            "friends": {
                "db": "restheart",
                "collection": "star-wars-characters",
                "find": { "_id": { "$in": { "$fk": "friends" } } }
            }
        }
    }
}
----

=== Query

The GraphQL schema defines the queries `hero` and `search`

[source,graphql]
----
type Query {
  hero(episode: Episode!): Character
  search(text: String!): [SearchResult]
}
----

Queries always require mappings.

TIP: for more information on query mappings see link:/docs/mongodb-graphql/graphql-apps#field-to-query-mapping[Field-to-query Mapping]

[source,json]
----
{
    "mappings": {
        "Query": {
            "hero": {
                "db": "restheart",
                "collection": "star-wars-characters",
                "find": { "heroOf": { "$arg": "episode" } }
            },
            "search": {
                "db": "restheart",
                "collection": "star-wars-characters",
                "find": { "name": { "$regex": { "$arg": "text" } , "$options": "i" } } }
        }
    }
