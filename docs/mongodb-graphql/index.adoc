== Overview

The `restheart-graphql` plugin exposes a read-only (no mutations and subscription) GraphQL API for inquiring MongoDB resources.

The GraphQL API works side by side with the REST API to build modern applications.

== Configuration

For each GraphQL application you need to define a so called *GraphQL app definition*. This is a JSON document to be created by default in the `/graphql` collection.

The GraphQL plugin default configuration follows:
 It also allows to specify the collection that holds the app definitions.

[source,yml]
----
graphql:
  uri: /graphql
  db: restheart
  collection: gql-apps
  # app definitions are cached. this sets the time to live in msecs
  app-def-cache-ttl: 10_000
  # default-limit is used for queries that don't not specify a limit
  default-limit: 100
  # max-limit is the maximum value for a Query limit
  max-limit: 1000
  # The time limit in milliseconds for processing queries. Set to 0 for no time limit.
  query-time-limit: 0
  verbose: false
----

The GraphQL application can be dynamically created and updated by simply creating or updating the related document in MongoDB.

== GraphQL App Definition

A GraphQL application definition is composed by three sections:

[source,json]
----
{
  "descriptor": "...",
  "schema": "...",
  "mappings": "..."
}
----

== Descriptor

Here you can specify:

-  `name`: GraphQL application name.
-  `description`: GraphQL application description.
-  `enabled`: can be `true` or `false`.
-  `uri`: specifies at which endpoint your GraphQL application is reachable (e.g. `/graphql/uri`). If the `uri` parameter is missing the application's name is used instead.

[source,json]
----
{
  "descriptor": {
    "name": "MyApp",
    "description": "my first test GraphQL application",
    "enabled": true,
    "uri": "myapp"
  },
  "schema": "...",
  "mappings": "..."
}
----

== Schema

This section must contain GraphQL application's schema written with *Schema Definition Language* (SDL). For example:

[source,json]
----
{
  "descriptor": "...",
  "schema": "type User{name: String surname: String email: String posts: [Post]} type Post{text: String author: User} type Query{users(limit: Int = 0, skip: Int = 0)}",
  "mappings": "..."
}
----

NOTE: In order the schema to be a valid, it must contain the type *Query*.

== Mappings

GraphQL types are connected to MongoDB data through mappings.

Mappings are applicable to a range of types, including Object, Query, `enum`, `interfaces`, and `union`.

=== Field to Field mapping

You can map a GraphQL Object field with a specific MongoDB document field or with an element of a MongoDB array. To map nested fields use the **dot-notation**.

An example follows:

[source,json]
----
{
  "descriptor": "...",
  "schema": "...",
  "mappings":{
    "User": {
      "name": "firstName",
      "phone": "contacts.phone",
      "email": "contacts.emails.0",
    },
    "Post": "...",
    "Query": "..."
  }
}
----

In this configuration:

The `name` field is linked to the MongoDB document's `firstName` field.
The `phone` field is associated with the `phone` field within the nested `contacts` document.
The `email` field is connected to the first element of the `emails` array within the nested `contacts` document.

NOTE: if you don't explicitly define a mapping for a field, RESTHeart will automatically map it to the MongoDB document field with the same name.

=== Field to Query mapping

You can establish a mapping between a GraphQL Object field and a MongoDB query using the following parameters:

- `db` (String): The name of the database.
- `collection` (String): The name of the collection.
- `find` (Document): The selection filter using query operators such as `$in`, `$and`, `$or`, and others.
- `sort` (Document): The order in which the query returns matching documents.
- `skip` (Document or Integer): The number of documents to skip among those resulting from the query.
- `limit` (Document or Integer): The maximum number of documents to return among those resulting from the query.

NOTE: It's important to note that unlimited queries are not allowed. If the query doesn't specify a `limit`, the service configuration's `default-limit` is applied. Additionally, the limit cannot exceed the `max-limit`.

=== Field to Aggregation mapping

You can link a GraphQL Object field with a MongoDB aggregation using the following parameters:

- `db` (String): The name of the database.
- `collection` (String): The name of the collection.
- `stages` (Array): An array of aggregation stages.

Similar to field-to-query mapping, you can utilize `$arg` and `$fk` operators within aggregation stages. In reference to the previous mapping example, the following aggregation stages are possible:

[source,json]
----
"Query": {
    "countPostsByCategory": {
      "db": "restheart",
      "collection": "users",
      "stages": [
        { "$group": { "_id": "$category", "count": { "$count": {} } } }
      ]
    }
  }
----

And the Query in the GraphQL schema will now have the following field:

[source,graphql]
----
type Stats {
  _id: String
  count: Int
}

type Query {
  countPostsByCategory: [Stats]
}
----

==== Optional Stages

Starting from RESTHeart v7.6, field-to-aggregation mapping can include optional stages that are executed only when one or more arguments are specified. This feature enables the handling of optional GraphQL arguments.

NOTE: Optional Stages are available from RESTHeart v7.6.

Optional Stages in field-to-aggregation mapping are similar to Optional Stages in regular aggregations. The main difference lies in the conditional operators used. In field-to-aggregation mapping, the optional stage operator is `$ifarg`, whereas in regular aggregations, it is `$ifvar`.

For a more in-depth understanding of how to use optional stages in both field-to-aggregation mapping and regular aggregations, please refer to the link:/docs/mongodb-rest/aggregations#optional-stages[Aggregation documentation].

=== Mappings operators

_Field to Query_ and _Field to Aggregation_ mappings provide the flexibility to employ the `$arg` and `$fk` operators:

- `$arg`: This operator enables the utilization of GraphQL arguments within mappings, enhancing dynamic query or aggregation generation.
- `$fk`: It allows the specification of the document field responsible for holding a relation. It enables traversing related documents.

For instance, consider the following GraphQL schema:

[source,graphql]
----
type User {
  id: Int!
  name: String
  posts: [Post]
}

type Post {
  id: Int!
  text: String
  category: String
  author: User
}

type Query {
  usersByName(_name: String!, _limit: Int = 0, _skip: Int = 0): [Users]
}
----

with MongoDB data organized in the two collections `users` and `posts`:

**USERS**
[source,json]
----
{
  "_id": "foo",
  "firstName": "Foo",
  "lastName": "Bar",
  "contacts": { "phone": "+39113", "emails": ["foo@domain.com", "f.bar@domain.com"] },
  "posts_ids": [ 1, 2 ]
}
----

**POSTS**
[source,json]
----
[
  { "_id": 1,
    "text": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet",
    "category": "front-end",
    "author_id": "foo"
  },
  { "_id": 2,
    "text": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet",
    "category": "back-end",
    "author_id": "foo"
  }
]
----

The possible mappings are:

[source,json]
----
{
  "descriptor": "...",
  "schema": "...",
  "mappings": {
    "User": {
      "posts": {
        "db": "restheart",
        "collection": "posts",
        "find": { "_id": { "$in": { "$fk": "posts_ids" } } }
      }
    },
    "Post": {
      "author": {
        "db": "restheart",
        "collection": "user",
        "find": { "_id": { "$fk": "author_id" } }
      }
    },
    "Query": {
      "usersByName": {
        "db": "restheart",
        "collection": "users",
        "find": { "name": { "$arg": "_name" } },
        "limit": { "$arg": "_limit" },
        "skip": { "$arg": "_skip" },
        "sort": { "name": -1 }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

As a result of using these mapping operators:

- When given a `User`, their posts are represented by the MongoDB documents within the `posts` collection. These documents have an `_id` field value that matches any of the `_id` values within the `posts_ids` array in the `User`'s document.

- When given a `Post`, its author is identified by the MongoDB document within the `users` collection. This document has an `_id` field value that matches the `author_id` within the `Post`'s document.

- For the `userByName` GraphQL field, the MongoDB documents being queried are those within the `users` collection with a `name` field equal to the value specified in the `_name` GraphQL argument. Furthermore, you can specify that you want to return a maximum of `_limit` documents, skip the first `_skip` documents, and have them sorted by name in reverse order.

NOTE: the `$fk` and `$arg` operators allow the usage of dot notation to traverse document fields.

NOTE: the `$arg` operator allows dot notation from RESTHeart v7.6 onwards.

=== Dot Notation support for `$arg` and `$fk`

The `$fk` and `$arg` operator can utilize dot notation to access nested properties.

NOTE: Dot Notation support for `$arg` is available from RESTHeart v7.6

The Dot Notation support for `$arg` feature enables the handling of `InputTypes`. The following example  will clarify:

[source,graphql]
----
input Filters {
  type: String
  author: String
}

type Query {
  getPosts(filters: Filters!): [Post]
}
----

The Query mapping can use the dot notation as follows to cope the `Filters InputType`:

[source,json]
{ "mappings": {
    "Query": {
        "getPosts": {
            "db": "restheart",
            "collection": "the-posts",
            "find": { "author": { "$arg": "filters.author" }, "type": { "$arg": "filters.type" } }
        }
    }
}

=== Arguments with Default Values

The `$arg` operator can specify a default value. This default value is utilized when an optional argument is not provided in the GraphQL Query.

NOTE: Arguments with Default Values are available from RESTHeart v7.6.

Arguments with Default Values in GraphQL mappings are similar to those in regular aggregations. The primary distinction lies in the operators used. In GraphQL mappings, the operator is `$arg`, whereas in regular aggregations, it is `$var`.

For example, the following code specifies the default value `Andrea` for the argument `name`: `{"$arg": [ "name", "Andrea"]}`.

For a more comprehensive understanding of how to use arguments with default values, please refer to the link:/docs/mongodb-rest/aggregations#variables-with-default-values[Aggregation documentation].

=== The `rootDoc` argument

NOTE: `rootDoc` is available from RESTHeart v7.6

TIP: more details about this feature are available on github link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/issues/469[issue 469]

The `{"$arg": "rootDoc"}` argument is a versatile tool that can be employed in both _Field to Query_ and _Field to Aggregation_ mappings.

It enables the utilization of properties from the root document when crafting queries and aggregations.

The root document, in this context, is the first document retrieved from the source.

To provide a clear example, let's consider a document from the collection `authors-and-posts`:

The example is implemented in test link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/core/src/test/java/karate/graphql/rootDoc/rootDoc.feature[rootDoc.feature]

[source,json]
----
  {
  "_id": "bar",
  "sub": {
    "posts": [
      { "content": "ping", "visible": true },
      { "content": "pong", "visible": true },
      { "content": "invisible", "visible": false }
    ]
  }
}
----

And the following GraphQL schema. Note that the field `post` has the argument `visible`.

[source,graphql]
----
type User {
  _id: String
  posts(visible: Boolean): [Post]
}
type Post {
  content: String
}
type Query {
  users: [User]
}
----

In order to filter the nested posts objects according to the argument `visible` we can make use of field to aggregation mapping:

[source,json]
----
{
  "User": {
    "posts": {
      "db": "restheart",
      "collection": "authors-and-posts",
      "stages": [
        { "$match": { "_id": { "$arg": "rootDoc._id" } } },
        { "$unwind" : "$sub.posts"  },
        { "$replaceRoot": {"newRoot": "$sub.posts"} },
        { "$match": { "visible": { "$arg": "visible" } } }
    ]
    }
  }
}
----

The field to aggregation mapping selects the root user using the `rootDoc` and filters the objects in the nested array `sub.posts` that match the argument `visible`.

=== Enum mappings

NOTE: available from v7.2

Enum type mappings serve to define the correspondence between values in MongoDB and the corresponding enum values.

However, it's essential to note that enum mappings are optional. When omitted, it is assumed that the value in the database is identical to the string representation of the enum value.

For instance, consider the following `enum`:

[source,graphql]
----
enum Level { ENTRY, MEDIUM, ADVANCED }
----

Can be mapped to numeric values as follows:

[source,json]
----
"Level": {
    "ENTRY": 0,
    "MEDIUM": 1,
    "ADVANCED": 2
}
----

NOTE: An example GraphQL application that uses `enum` is link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/core/src/test/java/karate/graphql/enum-union-interface/enumTestApp.json[enumTestApp.json] used in the test link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/core/src/test/java/karate/graphql/enum-union-interface/enum.feature[enum.feature]

=== Interface mappings

NOTE: available from v7.2

An interface in GraphQL is an abstract type that specifies a particular set of fields that any concrete type implementing the interface must include.

To determine which concrete type a value belongs to when querying against the interface, a _TypeResolver_ must be defined in the interface mappings.

Let's consider an example involving an interface and concrete objects:

[source,graphql]
----
interface Course { _id: ObjectId, title: String }
type InternalCourse implements Course { _id: ObjectId, title: String }
type ExternalCourse implements Course { _id: ObjectId, title: String, deliveredBy: String }
type Query { AllCourses: [Course] }
----

The following mappings defines the _TypeResolver_ using the `$typeResolver` keyword.

[source,json]
----
"Course": {
    "$typeResolver": {
        "InternalCourse": "not field-exists(deliveredBy)",
        "ExternalCourse": "field-exists(deliveredBy)"
    }
}
----

The `$typeResolver` serves as an object that establishes a mapping between the names of concrete types (such as `InternalCourse` and `ExternalCourse`) and corresponding predicates. These predicates are evaluated against a document, and if a predicate returns `true`, the GraphQL type associated with that predicate is used to represent the document.

This mechanism allows for dynamic determination of the GraphQL type for a document based on the conditions defined in the predicates. It's a powerful way to handle polymorphism and resolve the actual type of objects when querying against an interface.

`$typeResolver` can use the following predicates:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|*predicate*|*description*
|`and` | boolean `and` operator
|`or` | boolean `or` operator
|`not` | boolean `not` operator
|`field-exists` | checks if the type document contains the specified keys. Dot notation and multiple keys are permitted as in `field-exists(foo.bar, bar.foo)`
|`field-eq` | checks if the specified type key is equal to a value. The key can use the dot notation and the value can be any JSON as in `field-eq(field=foo.bar, value='{ "n": 1 }')`.
|`value-eq` | checks if the type value is equal to the given argument. The argument can be any JSON as in `value-eq('{ "n": 1 }')`.
|===


WARNING: the value of the `field-eq` predicate must be valid JSON. In particular pay attention to string values that require two quotes as in `field-eq(field=foo, value='"bar"')`.

==== Examples of `field-eq` predicates

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|*predicate*|*condition*
|`field-eq(field=n, value=100)`|field `n` equals number `100`
|`field-eq(field=n, value='"100"')`|field `n` equals string `"100"`
|`field-eq(field=b, value=true)`|field `b` equals boolean value `true`
|`field-eq(field=o, value='{ "bar": 1 }')`|field `o` equals JSON Object `{ "bar": 1 }`
|`field-eq(field=s, value='"foo"')`|field `s` equals string `"foo"`
|===

NOTE: An example GraphQL application that uses `interface` is link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/core/src/test/java/karate/graphql/enum-union-interface/interfaceTestApp.json[interfaceTestApp.json] used in the test link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/core/src/test/java/karate/graphql/enum-union-interface/interface.feature[interface.feature]

=== Union mappings

NOTE: available from v7.2

Union types in GraphQL are similar to interfaces in that they represent a way to include multiple types in a single field. However, unlike interfaces, union types do not specify any fields that the types within the union must have in common.

With union types, you can specify that a field can return values of different types, and you can use this construct when you want to retrieve data that doesn't share a common set of fields but still needs to be represented as a single field in your schema. This is particularly useful for scenarios where you have different types of data that can be queried together under one field, even if they have different structures.

[source,graphql]
----
union Course = InternalCourse | ExternalCourse
type InternalCourse { _id: ObjectId, title: String }
type ExternalCourse { _id: ObjectId, title: String, deliveredBy: String }
----

As for interfaces, a _TypeResolver_ must be defined in the union mappings to decide which type a concrete value belongs to.

The format for union's `$typeResolver` is identical to interface's.

NOTE: An example GraphQL application that uses `union` is link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/core/src/test/java/karate/graphql/enum-union-interface/unionTestApp.json[unionTestApp.json] used in the test link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/core/src/test/java/karate/graphql/enum-union-interface/union.feature[union.feature]

== Bson types

All primitive GraphQL types have been mapped to corresponding BSON types plus a set of custom GraphQL scalars types have been added:

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|*GraphQL type*|*Bson Type*|*Example*
|`Boolean` |`BsonBoolean` |`true`
|`String` |`BsonString` |`"foo"`
|`Int` |`BsonInt32` |`1`
|`Long` |`BsonInt64` |`{ "$numberLong": "10000000000000000000" }`
|`Float` |`BsonDouble` |`{ "$numberDouble": "1.0" }`
|`Decimal128` |`BsonDecimal128` |`{ "$numberDecimal": "123.456" }`
|`ObjectId` |`BsonObjectId` |`{ "$oid": "618d18d6d058286395bb5567" }`
|`Timestamp` |`BsonTimestamp` |`{ "$timestamp": {"t": 1, "i": 1} }`
|`DateTime` |`BsonDate` |`{ "$date": 1639666957000 }`
|`Regex` |`BsonRegex` |`{ "$regex": "<sRegex>", "$options": "<sOptions>" }`
|`BsonDocument` |`BsonDocument` |`{ "any": 1, "possible": 1, "document": 1 }`|
|===

=== Example

The following GraphQL type `User` defines the property `_id` to be of type `ObjectId`

[source,graphql]
----
type User {
    _id: ObjectId
    name: String
    surname: String
    email: String
    posts: [Post]
}
----

== Queries

In order to make a query you can use HTTP request with POST method and both content-type `application/json` and `application/graphql`. For instance:

=== `application/json`

[source,http]
----
POST /graphql/<app-uri> HTTP/1.1
Host: <host-name>
Content-Type: application/json
----

[.text-muted]
*Request body*
[source,json]
----
{
  "query": "query test_operation($name: String){ userByName(_name: $name){name posts{text}} }",
  "variables": { "name": "..." },
  "operationName": "..."
}
----

=== `application/graphql`


[source,http]
----
POST /graphql/<app-uri> HTTP/1.1
Host: <host-name>
Content-Type: application/graphql
----

[.text-muted]
*Request body*
[source,grahpql]
----
{
  userByName(_name: "...") {
      name
      posts {
        text
      }
  }
}
----

## Limitations

The GraphQL service has the following limitations:

- **Read-only API**: mutations are not supported; the GraphQL API is only intended for simplifying data fetching. To write data, the REST API must be used.

## Response

Starting from RESTHeart v7.6, the GraphQL API always responds with the content type `application/graphql-response+json`, following the link:https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/blob/main/spec/GraphQLOverHTTP.md[GraphQL Over HTTP specs].

**Possible Response Codes:**

[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|===
| *HTTP Status Code* | *Description*

| 200
| A valid GraphQL response has been generated, even if it contains errors (partial data).

| 400
| The request is invalid (e.g., incorrect JSON, malformed GraphQL query, non-existent fields in selection, etc.) or when the response only contains errors (i.e., `data: null`).

| 404
| The GraphQL app does not exist.

| 405
| Incorrect method used (not POST or OPTIONS).

| 408
| Request timed out due to the `query-time-limit` option.

| 500
| Connection error with MongoDB.

|===
