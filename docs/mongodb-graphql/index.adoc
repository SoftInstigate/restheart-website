The `restheart-graphql` plugin provides a read-only GraphQL API for MongoDB, complementing the REST API for modern applications.

Queries are made through HTTP POST requests with `application/json` or `application/graphql` content types, and responses are in `application/graphql-response+json` format.

Key Points:

- *Supports all GraphQL types*: `type`, `query`, `enum`, `interface`, `union`, and `input`.
- GraphQL applications require a JSON document, the *GraphQL app definition*, stored in the `/graphql` collection.
- App definition includes *Descriptor* (app name, description, enabled status, URI), *Schema* (GraphQL SDL), and *Mappings* (connecting types to MongoDB data).
- Mappings include *Field-to-Field* (mapping GraphQL to MongoDB fields), *Field-to-Query* (connecting GraphQL Object field to MongoDB query), and *Field-to-Aggregation* (linking GraphQL Object field to MongoDB aggregation stages).
- Mappings leverage `$arg` and `$fk` *operators* for flexibility in handling GraphQL arguments and traversing related documents.
- Support for features like *Optional Stages*, *Arguments with Default Values*, and `*rootDoc` Argument* for crafting queries and aggregations.
- Extends GraphQL typing system for *MongoDB data types* (e.g., `BsonObjectId`, `BsonDocument`).
- Provide automatically schema fetching for *query autocompletion and syntax checking* in popular clients like Postman and Insomnia.
- Provide an *optimization feature* that mitigates the N+1 requests problem.
