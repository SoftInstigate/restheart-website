This guide will help you quickly set up and create your first GraphQL API with RESTHeart. We'll cover installation, basic configuration, and creating a simple GraphQL application.

=== Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

* RESTHeart v7.6.4 or later
* MongoDB 4.2 or later
* A REST client (like cURL, Postman, or RESTNinja)

=== Quick Setup

==== 1. Start RESTHeart and MongoDB

The fastest way to get started is using Docker Compose:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/master/docker-compose.yml --output docker-compose.yml
$ docker compose up
----

This starts both RESTHeart and MongoDB with default configurations.

==== 2. Create Required Collections

Create the collection for storing GraphQL app definitions:

[source,http]
----
PUT /gql-apps HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0
----

==== 3. Create Your First GraphQL App

Let's create a simple book catalog API. First, create a collection for books:

[source,http]
----
PUT /books HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0
----

Add some sample data:

[source,http]
----
POST /books HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0
Content-Type: application/json

[
    {
        "_id": 1,
        "title": "The GraphQL Guide",
        "author": "Sarah Smith",
        "year": 2023,
        "genres": ["Technical", "Programming"]
    },
    {
        "_id": 2,
        "title": "MongoDB Basics",
        "author": "John Doe",
        "year": 2022,
        "genres": ["Database", "Technical"]
    }
]
----

Now, create your GraphQL app definition:

[source,http]
----
POST /gql-apps HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "_id": "book-catalog",
    "descriptor": {
        "name": "Book Catalog",
        "description": "A simple book catalog API",
        "enabled": true,
        "uri": "books"
    },
    "schema": "type Book { _id: Int! title: String! author: String! year: Int genres: [String] } type Query { books(year: Int): [Book] booksByGenre(genre: String!): [Book] }",
    "mappings": {
        "Query": {
            "books": {
                "db": "restheart",
                "collection": "books",
                "find": {
                    "year": { "$arg": "year" }
                }
            },
            "booksByGenre": {
                "db": "restheart",
                "collection": "books",
                "find": {
                    "genres": { "$arg": "genre" }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----

=== Testing Your GraphQL API

==== 1. Query All Books

[source,http]
----
POST /graphql/books HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0
Content-Type: application/graphql

{
    books {
        title
        author
        year
    }
}
----

==== 2. Query Books by Genre

[source,http]
----
POST /graphql/books HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0
Content-Type: application/graphql

{
    booksByGenre(genre: "Technical") {
        title
        author
    }
}
----

== Understanding the Components

1. *GraphQL App Definition*:
   - `descriptor`: Metadata about your GraphQL API
   - `schema`: Your GraphQL schema in SDL format
   - `mappings`: Connects GraphQL types to MongoDB queries

2. *Schema*:
   - Defines available types (`Book`)
   - Specifies queries (`books`, `booksByGenre`)
   - Declares field types and requirements

3. *Mappings*:
   - Links queries to MongoDB collections
   - Handles query parameters using `$arg`
   - Supports complex MongoDB queries

== Next Steps

Now that you have your first GraphQL API running, you can:

1. Learn about link:/docs/mongodb-graphql/schema[Schema Design] for more complex APIs
2. Explore link:/docs/mongodb-graphql/mappings[MongoDB Mappings] for advanced queries
3. Try the link:/docs/mongodb-graphql/tutorial[Star Wars Tutorial] for a more complex example
4. Read about link:/docs/mongodb-graphql/optimization[Performance Optimization]
