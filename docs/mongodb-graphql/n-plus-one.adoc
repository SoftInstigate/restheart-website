When working with GraphQL APIs, especially those connected to databases like MongoDB, one of the most common performance challenges is the N+1 query problem. This article explains what this problem is, how it affects RESTHeart GraphQL applications, and how to solve it.

== What is the N+1 Problem?

The N+1 problem occurs when your GraphQL query needs to resolve related data, resulting in N additional database queries on top of the initial query. This typically happens when resolving lists of objects that have relationships to other objects.

=== Example Scenario

Consider the following GraphQL schema:

[source,graphql]
----
type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  author: User!
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Query {
  posts(limit: Int = 10): [Post!]!
}
----

When executing a query like:

[source,graphql]
----
{
  posts(limit: 10) {
    title
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}
----

This leads to:
1. One query to fetch 10 posts
2. Ten additional queries (N=10) to fetch each post's author

Thus, 11 total queries (1 + N) are executed instead of what could potentially be done in 1-2 optimized queries.

== Impact on Performance

The N+1 problem can significantly impact your API's performance:

* *Increased Latency*: Each additional query adds network round-trip time
* *Database Load*: Multiple individual queries stress the database more than fewer optimized queries
* *Network Traffic*: More queries mean more network overhead
* *Resource Usage*: Higher CPU and memory usage on both server and database

== Solutions in RESTHeart

RESTHeart provides several built-in solutions to mitigate the N+1 problem:

=== 1. DataLoader Integration

RESTHeart includes DataLoader support out of the box. Enable it in your field mappings:

[source,json]
----
{
  "mappings": {
    "Post": {
      "author": {
        "db": "mydb",
        "collection": "users",
        "find": { "_id": { "$fk": "author_id" } },
        "dataLoader": {
          "batching": true,
          "caching": true,
          "maxBatchSize": 100
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

=== 2. Field-Level Caching

Enable caching for frequently accessed, relatively static data:

[source,json]
----
{
  "mappings": {
    "Post": {
      "author": {
        "db": "mydb",
        "collection": "users",
        "find": { "_id": { "$fk": "author_id" } },
        "dataLoader": {
          "caching": true,
          "ttl": 300  // Cache for 5 minutes
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

=== 3. Optimized Query Strategies

Use MongoDB's aggregation capabilities for more efficient data fetching:

[source,json]
----
{
  "mappings": {
    "Query": {
      "posts": {
        "db": "mydb",
        "collection": "posts",
        "stages": [
          { "$limit": { "$arg": "limit" } },
          {
            "$lookup": {
              "from": "users",
              "localField": "author_id",
              "foreignField": "_id",
              "as": "author"
            }
          },
          { "$unwind": "$author" }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
----

== Best Practices

1. *Analyze Query Patterns*
- Use RESTHeart's verbose logging to identify N+1 issues
- Monitor query execution times and patterns

2. *Strategic DataLoader Usage*
- Enable batching for related data fetching
- Set appropriate batch sizes based on your data patterns
- Use caching when data is relatively static

3. *Schema Design*
- Consider denormalization for frequently accessed data
- Use pagination to limit result sets
- Structure queries to minimize nested relationships

4. *Monitor and Tune*
- Watch database performance metrics
- Adjust batch sizes and cache settings based on real usage
- Use the DataLoader statistics in development mode
