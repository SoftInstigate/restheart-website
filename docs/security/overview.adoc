== Introduction

RESTHeart provides **Authentication** and **Authorization** services. It can handle different authentication and authorization schemes, including handling users and permissions stored in MongoDB collections.

The default configuration file enables `mongoRealmAuthenticator` and `mongoAclAuthorizer`. These use MongoDB collections (by default `/users` and `/acl` respectively) to handle users credentials and permissions respectively.

RESTHeart can also handle users and permissions stored on configuration files via `fileRealmAuthenticator` and `fileAclAuthorizer`. Enabling these plugins requires updating the configuration.

== Understanding RESTHeart security

RESTHeart is built around a **pluggable architecture**. It comes with a strong security implementation but you can extend it by implementing plugins.

In RESTHeart everything is a plugin including Authentication Mechanisms, Authenticators, Authorizers, Token Managers and Services.

Different **Authentication Mechanisms** manage different authentication schemes.
An example is _BasicAuthMechanism_ that handles the Basic Authentication scheme. It extracts the credentials from a request header and passes them to the an Authenticator for verification.

A different example is the _IdentityAuthMechanism_ that binds the request to a single identity specified by configuration. This Authentication Mechanism does not require an Authenticator to build the account.

RESTHeart allows defining several mechanism. As an in-bound request is received, the `authenticate()` method is called on each mechanism in turn until one of the following occurs:

-   A mechanism successfully authenticates the incoming request &#8594; the request proceeds to Authorization phase;
-   The list of mechanisms is exhausted &#8594; the request fails with code `401 Unauthorized`.

The **Authenticator** verifies the credentials extracted from the request by Authentication Mechanism. For instance, the _BasicAuthMechanism_ extracts the credentials from the request in the form of id and password. The Authenticator can check these credentials against a database or a LDAP server. Note that some Authentication Mechanisms don't actually rely on a Authenticator to build the Account.

The **Authorizer** is responsible of checking if the user can actually perform the request against an Access Control List. For instance the _RequestPredicatesAuthorizer_ checks if the request is allowed by looking at the role based permissions defined using the undertow predicate definition language.

The **Token Manager** is responsible of generating and validating an auth-token. When a client successfully authenticates, the Token Manager generates an auth-token that is returned in the `Auth-Token` response header. It can be used to authenticate further requests. This requires an Authentication Manager to handle it using the Token Manager for token validation.

A **Service** is a quick way of implementing Web Services to expose additional custom logic.
