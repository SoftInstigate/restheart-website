## Introduction

See [Understanding RESTHeart Security](/docs/security/overview#understanding-restheart-security) for an high level view of the RESTHeart security model.

RESTHeart is built around a **pluggable architecture**. It comes with a strong security implementation but you can easily extend it by implementing plugins. This section documents the authorizers available out-of-the-box.

RESTHeart by default offers two implementations authorizers:

1. Mongo ACL Authorizer
1. File ACL Authorizer

However, it's even possible to develop **custom authorizers**. Please refer to [Develop Security Plugins](/docs/plugins/security-plugins) for more information.

## Mongo ACL Authorizer

_mongoAclAuthorizer_ authorizes requests according to the _Access Control List_ defined in a **MongoDB collection**.
The configuration allows:

-   defining the collection to use to store ACL documents (`acl-db` and `acl-collection`).
-   enabling the root role (`root-role`): users with root role, can execute any requests, regardless of the permissions set in the ACL. Set it to null (`root-role: null`) to disable it.
-   controlling the ACL caching.

```yml
authorizers:
    mongoAclAuthorizer:
        acl-db: restheart
        acl-collection: acl
        # clients with root-role can execute any request
        root-role: admin
        cache-enabled: true
        cache-size: 1000
        cache-ttl: 5000
        cache-expire-policy: AFTER_WRITE
```

### Format of an ACL document

An example ACL document follows:

```json
{
    "_id": { "$oid": "5d9485639eab3a852d48a1de" },
    "predicate": "path-prefix[/blog] and (method[GET] or method[POST])",
    "roles": ["editor"],
    "priority": 1,
    "readFilter": {
        "_$or": [
            { "author": { "_$eq": "%USER" } },
            { "status": { "_$eq": "PUBLISHED" } }
        ]
    },
    "writeFilter": { "author": { "_$eq": "%USER" } }
}
```

The properties of the ACL document are:

{: .table.table-responsive }
|property|type|description|
|-|-|
|**predicate**|string|If the [undertow predicate](http://undertow.io/undertow-docs/undertow-docs-2.0.0/index.html#textual-representation) resolves the request then the request is authorized. Many examples of predicates can be found in the file [acl.yml](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/core/etc/acl.yml)|
|**roles**|JSON array of strings|The roles that are applied the ACL document. The special role `$unauthenticated` applies to requests that are not authenticated.|
|**priority**|number|A request might fulfill several predicates; an ACL document with higher priority has higher evaluation precedence.|
|**readFilter**|`null` or JSON object|An optional [filter](/docs/read-docs/#filtering) that is added to GET requests when authorized by this ACL document.|
|**writeFilter**|`null` or JSON object|An optional filter that is added to write requests when authorized by this ACL document.|

### Using readFilter and writeFilter

{: .bs-callout.bs-callout-info }
`readFilter` and `writeFilter` allows to partition data by roles.

The example ACL document applies to users with `editor` role. A user with this role can execute the requests `GET /blog` and `POST /blog`.

The `readFilter` applies to GET requests. The example ACL document limits the returned `/blog` documents to the ones that were published or that were created by the authenticated user.

The `writeFilter` applies to write request. The example ACL document allows the requests to only modify the documents that were created by the authenticated user.

{: .bs-callout.bs-callout-warning }
`writeFilter` only limits updates and cannot avoid creating documents that don't match the filter. The properties used in the filter should be set using [Interceptors](/docs/plugins/security-plugins/).

`readFilter` and `writeFilter` can use the following variables:

{: .table.table-responsive }
|variable|resolved to|example|
|-|-|
|%USER|the string id of the authenticated user|match documents with `author` property equal to the id of the authenticated user `{"author":"%USER"}`|
|%ROLES|the roles array of the authenticated user|match documents with `roles` array property containing any role of the authenticated user `{"roles": {"_$in": %ROLES }`|
|%NOW|the current date as `{"$date": 1570027863000 }`|match documents with `timestamp` date property less than (before) the current date `{"timestamp":{"_$lt": "%NOW"}}`|

## File ACL Authorizer

_fileRealmAuthorizer_ allows defining roles permissions in a YAML configuration file using the [Undertow predicate language](http://undertow.io/undertow-docs/undertow-docs-2.0.0/index.html#textual-representation).

```yml
authorizers:
    fileAclAuthorizer:
        conf-file: ./etc/acl.yml
```

The file [acl.yml](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/core/etc/acl.yml) defines the role based permissions. An example follows:

```yml
## configuration file for requestPredicatesAuthorizer
permissions:
    # OPTIONS is always allowed
    - role: $unauthenticated
      predicate: path-prefix[path="/"] and method[value="OPTIONS"]

    - role: $unauthenticated
      predicate: path-prefix[path="/echo"] and method[value="GET"]

    - role: admin
      predicate: path-prefix[path="/"] and method[value="OPTIONS"]

    - role: admin
      predicate: path-prefix[path="/"]

    - role: user
      predicate: path-prefix[path="/"] and method[value="OPTIONS"]

    - role: user
      predicate: path-prefix[path="/secho"] and method[value="GET"]

    - role: user
      predicate: path[path="/secho/foo"] and method[value="GET"]

    - role: user
      predicate: (path[path="/echo"] or path[path="/secho"]) and method[value="PUT"]

    # This to check the path-template predicate
    - role: user
      predicate: path-template[value="/secho/{username}"] and equals[%u, "${username}"]

    # This to check the regex predicate
    - role: user
      predicate: regex[pattern="/secho/(.*?)", value="%R", full-match=true] and equals[%u, "${1}"]
```
