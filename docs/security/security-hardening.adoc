== Introduction

This section describes the security hardening features available with RESTHeart
and some best practices to protect against common attacks.

IMPORTANT: No system can guarantee 100% security. Security must be achieved through
a set of security hardening measures implemented on the whole system stack
and enforced by strong and efficient security policies.

== Update the `admin` user password

At first startup, RESTHeart initializes the user `admin`, with the default password `secret`. *This user can execute any request*.

WARNING: *YOU MUST UPDATE THE DEFAULT PASSWORD!* The role `admin` can execute any request as it is set as the `root` role in the `mongoAclAuthorizer` configuration.

To update it, run the following command:

[source,bash]
$ curl -u admin:secret -X PATCH localhost:8080/users/admin -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "password": "my-strong-password" }'

Refer to link:/docs/security/user-management/[User Management] for more information on how to create new users, roles and permissions.

=== Disable the auto-creation of the admin user

At startup time, the `mongoRealmAuthenticator` checks if the user `admin` exists. If it does not exist, it automatically creates it. This means that whenever the user `admin` is deleted, it will be eventually recreated with the default password `secret`.

To avoid this dangerous behavior, you should disable the auto-creation of the `admin` user:

[source,yml]
----
mongoRealmAuthenticator:
# other options omitted
# clients with root-role can execute any request
create-user: false # <---- disable auto-creation of the admin user
create-user-document: '{"_id": "admin", "password": "secret", "roles": ["admin"]}'
----

== Disable the root role

The `mongoAclAuthorizer` by default defines the _root_ role.

[source,yml]
----
mongoAclAuthorizer:
    # other options omitted
    # clients with root-role can execute any request
    root-role: admin
----

WARNING: this role is granted all permission, including reading and deleting any MongoDb resource.

When you have setup your ACL, the `root` role can be disabled as follow:

[source,yml]
----
mongoAclAuthorizer:
    # other options omitted
    # root role disabled!
    root-role: null
----

== Use HTTPS

WARNING: *IT IS PARAMOUNT TO SECURE RESTHEART WITH TLS.*

This can be achieved either by a reverse proxy (such as Nginx, AWS API gateway, etc)
or by configuring RESTHeart to only use the https-listener.

To configure RESTHeart to use TLS, follow the instructions at link:/docs/security/tls/[Configure TLS].

=== Secure connection to MongoDB

To configure RESTHeart to connect to MongoDB over TLS, follow the instructions at link:/docs/mongodb-rest/secure-connection-to-mongodb/[Secure connection to MongoDB].

It is also very important to restrict the access to the MongoDB database to only the resources that are required by RESTHeart; for this refer to link:/docs/mongodb-rest/secure-connection-to-mongodb/#restrict-permissions-of-mongodb-user[Restrict permissions of MongoDb User].

== Make sure password are stored in an encrypted form

Passwords must be stored in an encrypted form.

The default `mongoRealmAuthenticator` is recommended for production use and it does store the password in an encrypted form with the default configuration.

[source,yml]
----
mongoRealmAuthenticator:
    # omitting other options
    bcrypt-hashed-password: true
    bcrypt-complexity: 12
----

The `fileRealmAuthenticator` is for testing and development purposes only and not suggested for production use, since it does not support password hashing.

IMPORTANT: If you use a custom _Authenticator_ you must make sure that the passwords are stored in an encrypted form.

== Enforce strong passwords

If users can update their password, it is important enforcing that user-defined passwords are strong enough and avoid a user to chose a weak password like `123456`.

The default `mongoRealmAuthenticator` is recommended for production use and it allows to refuse to update user documents with weak passwords.

[source,yml]
----
mongoRealmAuthenticator:
    # omitting other options
    enforce-minimum-password-strenght: false
    # Integer from 0 to 4
    # 0 Weak        （guesses < 3^10）
    # 1 Fair        （guesses < 6^10）
    # 2 Good        （guesses < 8^10）
    # 3 Strong      （guesses < 10^10）
    # 4 Very strong （guesses >= 10^10）
    minimum-password-strength: 3
----

== bruteForceAttackGuard

`bruteForceAttackGuard` defends from brute force password cracking attacks
by returning `429 Too Many Requests` when more than `max-failed-attempts` wrong requests are received in last 10 seconds from the same ip.

IMPORTANT: if RESTHeart is behind a revers proxy, this must set the header `X-Forwarded-For` with the client IP. In this case set the option `trust-x-forwarded-for: true`

[source,yml]
----
# defends from brute force password cracking attacks
# by returning `429 Too Many Requests` when more than
# `max-failed-attempts` wrong requests
# are received in last 10 seconds from the same ip
bruteForceAttackGuard:
    enabled: false
    # if true, the source ip is obtained from X-Forwarded-For header
    # this requires that header being set by the proxy, dangerous otherwise
    trust-x-forwarded-for: false
    # max number of failed attempts in 10 seconds sliding window
    # before returning 429 Too Many Requests
    max-failed-attempts: 5
----

== originVetoer

The `originVetoer` authorizer protects from CSRF attacks by *forbidding requests whose `Origin` header is not whitelisted*.
It supports both exact origins and flexible patterns for allowed origins.

[NOTE]
====
This feature is *disabled by default*.  
To activate it, add the configuration below to your `restheart.yml` file and specify the allowed origins.
====

=== Configuration Example

[source,yaml]
----
originVetoer:
  enabled: true
  whitelist:
    - https://restheart.org
    - https://restheart.com
  whitelist-patterns:
    - https://*.mydomain.com
    - http://localhost:*
  ignore-paths:
    - /public/*
----

=== Configuration Properties

* `whitelist` +
A list of exact origins or prefixes. Requests with an `Origin` header that matches (or starts with) any entry in this list are allowed.
+
[source,yaml]
----
whitelist:
  - https://restheart.org
  - https://restheart.com
----

* `whitelist-patterns` +
A list of glob-like patterns for allowed origins. Use `*` as a wildcard for any sequence of characters.
+
[NOTE]
====
Available from RESTHeart version 8.5.0+
====
+
Examples:
- `https://*.mydomain.com` allows any subdomain of `mydomain.com`
- `http://localhost:*` allows any port on `localhost`
+
[source,yaml]
----
whitelist-patterns:
  - https://*.mydomain.com
  - http://localhost:*
----

* `ignore-paths` +
(Optional) A list of path patterns to ignore. Requests to these paths are accepted without checking the `Origin` header.
+
[source,yaml]
----
ignore-paths:
  - /public/*
  - /health
----

=== How It Works

. If the request path matches any `ignore-paths` entry, the request is accepted without checking the `Origin` header.
. If neither `whitelist` nor `whitelist-patterns` is defined, all origins are accepted.
. If the `Origin` header is missing, the request is rejected.
. The `Origin` header is checked against the `whitelist` (exact/prefix match).
. If not matched, the `Origin` header is checked against the `whitelist-patterns` (wildcard match).
. If the origin does not match any entry, the request is rejected.

=== Example

[source,yaml]
----
originVetoer:
  enabled: true
  whitelist:
    - https://restheart.org
    - https://restheart.com
  whitelist-patterns:
    - https://*.mydomain.com
    - http://localhost:*
  ignore-paths:
    - /public/*
----

With this configuration:

* Requests from `https://restheart.org` or `https://restheart.com` are allowed.
* Requests from `https://api.mydomain.com` or `http://localhost:8080` are allowed.
* Requests to `/public/*` are always allowed, regardless of the `Origin` header.
* All other origins are rejected.

== Define and test the ACL

The `mongoAclAuthorizer` allows to define a very fine grained, role based ACL.

The permissions set must allow to execute just the required requests, blacklisting unused query parameters, projecting the response to hide sensitive data, merging the request body with sensitive properties at the server-side, filtering writes and reads.

The following permission document is an example of a very fine grained ACL:

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "userCanCreateDocumentsInOwnCollection",
    "description": [
        "**** DESCRIPTION PROPERTY IS NOT REQUIRED, HERE ONLY FOR DOCUMENTATION PURPOSES",
        "allow role 'user' to create documents under /{userid}",
        "the request content must contain 'title' and 'content' <- bson-request-contains(title, content)",
        "the request content cannot contain any property other than 'title' and 'content' <- bson-request-whitelist(title, content)",
        "no qparams can be specified <- qparams-whitelist()",
        "the property 'author' and 'status' are added to the request at server-side <- mergeRequest",
        "the property 'log' with some request values is added to the request at server-side <- mergeRequest"
    ],
    "roles": ["user"],
    "priority": 100,
    "predicate": "method(POST) and path-template('/{userid}') and equals(@user._id, ${userid}) and bson-request-whitelist(title, content) and bson-request-contains(title, content) and qparams-whitelist()",
    "mongo": {
      "mergeRequest": {
        "author": "@user._id",
        "status": "draft",
        "log": "@request"
      }
    }
  }
----

Refer to link:/docs/security/authorization/#format-of-permissions[Format of permission] for more information.

NOTE: When the permission language cannot be used and you need more control, you can define a custom `Vetoer` or an `Request Interceptor` that can enforce additional checking logic.

=== Use only aggregations and forbid the `filter` query parameter

The `filter` query parameter for the Mongo REST API allows clients to execute any MongoDB query.

This is very convenient at development time, however when you are ready to deploy your application, you should blacklist the `filter` query parameter in your ACL and rely on link:/docs/mongodb-rest/aggregations/[Aggregations] to expose, well defined and secured queries.

== Blacklist the `$where` MongoDB operator

If you cannot disable the `filter` query parameter, you can blacklist unused operators, using the `filterOperatorsBlacklist` plugin.

The `$where` MongoDB query operator is dangerous and should not be used in any case.

NOTE: `filterOperatorsBlacklist` is enabled by default and blacklists `$where`.

== Define role-specific GraphQL applications

NOTE: The GraphQL API is read-only, so you should only pay attention to avoid exposing sensitive information to users. This very important due to the nature of GraphQL that allows the client to request data in any format allowed by the GraphQL schema.

In order secure the GraphQL API, several GraphQL applications should be defined with different read logic and bound to different URIs. In this way, different roles can be granted access to different subsets of the GraphQL apps thus protecting the information.

WARNING: Protecting the GraphQL API requires the application definitions to be defined with the correct filtering options. Always test your APIs!
