This page summarizes the <a href="/assets/Brochure - RESTHeart 6.pdf" target="_blank" class=" ">PDF fact sheet</a>

**RESTHeart is a Ready-to-use Backend for the Modern Web** designed for *speed* and *simplicity* and downloaded by startups and enterprises to cut time and costs and make development pleasant.

## Fast development

RESTHeart provides developers with 80% of
the most common features and a modern framework to develop the remaining
20%
- Declarative Authentication and Authorization
- Instant REST, GraphQL and WebSocket API for MongoDB
- GraalVM powered Polyglot Framework to develop Services and Interceptors
- Fully documented

## Deploy at rest

RESTHeart is tailored for the JVM, GraalVM, Docker or Kubernetes, crafted from
best of breed libraries and standards, designed to radically simplify
microservices development and deployment.
- Ready-to-run Runtime
- Available as a standalone JAR file, native binary or Docker image
- Deploy it on Cloud and On-Premises

## Dual licensed

RESTHeart is dual-licensed under the AGPL and a Business Friendly Enterprise
License
- Enjoy the free AGPL distribution without feature restrictions
- Purchase the Enterprise License for production-grade support and to use
RESTHeart in closed source products or services

## The perfect MongoDB’s companion

RESTHeart automatically connects to MongoDB (or AWS DocumentDB and Azure CosmosDB)
- It exposes full database’s capabilities via REST, GraphQL and WebSocket APIs
- Developers don’t need to write a single line of code to serve JSON data and
binary content to Mobile Apps, Web Apps or Integration Middleware
- The Instant Data API cuts development complexity and costs up to 90%

## Modular and extensible

RESTHeart is modular and can be easily customized.
- The Core Runtime is the foundation
- Each functionality, e.g. the GraphQL API, is implemented in its own module
- Manage modules by adding or removing them from the “plugin” directory

## Extreme Performances

**Hundreds of thousands TPS**

RESTHeart parallel architecture provides superior performances.
[Read More](/docs/performances)

**Horizontal scaling**

RESTHeart is fully stateless and allows clustering, to
reach demanding requirements (only supported with
the Enterprise License).

**Even faster on GraalVM**

RESTHeart for GraalVM (supported with the Enterprise License) provides a native solution
with instant startup time and smaller memory footprint. This is perfect, for example, when
deploying to Kubernetes clusters, where regular Java applications usually consume too
many resources.
