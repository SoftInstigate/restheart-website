title: Load Sample Data into MongoDB
layout: docs-adoc
---

MongoDB provides a sample data set for testing and development.

This section describes how to load it into your MongoDB instance and configure RESTHeart to use it.

== Install the Database tools

You need `mongorestore` that is part of the MongoDB Database Tool.

To install it please refer to link:https://docs.mongodb.com/database-tools/[https://docs.mongodb.com/database-tools]

== Download the sample data

Download the sample data via the curl command:

[source,bash]
$ curl https://atlas-education.s3.amazonaws.com/sampledata.archive -o sampledata.archive

TIP: The data set is also available at the following address `https://download.restheart.com/sampledata.archive`. DISCLAIMER: the original data set is provided by MongoDB and available at this address only for educational purposes, MongoDB license terms might apply.

== Restore the sample data

Make sure MongoDB is running on `localhost:27017` (this command assumes it is not running with authentication required).

[source,bash]
$ mongorestore --archive=sampledata.archive

== The sample data

The sample data consist of the following databases:

[source,json]
----
[   "sample_airbnb",
    "sample_analytics",
    "sample_geospatial",
    "sample_mflix",
    "sample_restaurants",
    "sample_supplies",
    "sample_training",
    "sample_weatherdata"
]
----

Note that the default configuration of RESTHeart does not expose the sample data. It exposes only the database `restheart`.

To expose the sample data, you need to add the following configuration to your RESTHeart configuration file:

[source,yml]
----
mongo-mounts:
  - what: "*"
    where: /
----

Or you can simply add a database mount with the following configuration:

[source,yml]
----
mongo-mounts:
  - what: "/restheart"
    where: /
  - what: "/sample_mflix"
    where: /mflix
----
