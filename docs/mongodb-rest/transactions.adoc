== MongoDB Transactions

Multi-document transactions allow you to execute multiple operations as a single atomic unit. This enforces the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) across multiple documents and collections.

*Stay consistent!*

Enforce *A*tomicity, *C*onsistency, *I*solation and *D*urability with multi-document transactions.
****

=== Why Use Transactions?

In MongoDB, operations on a single document are always atomic. For many applications, this is sufficient because data can be structured with embedded documents and arrays to keep related data in a single document.

However, there are scenarios where you need to update multiple documents atomically:

* Financial operations affecting multiple accounts
* Inventory and order management
* User activity tracking across different collections
* Data migrations that need to maintain referential integrity

[IMPORTANT]
====
Multi-document transactions require MongoDB v4.0 or later configured as a Replica Set.

=== Sessions

Transactions in MongoDB are built on top of sessions. A session represents a sequence of related operations executed by an application.

==== Creating a Session

To start a session:

[source,http]
----
POST /_sessions HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "causallyConsistent": true
}
----

Response:

[source,http]
----
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: http://localhost:8080/_sessions/11c3ceb6-7b97-4f34-ba3f-689ea22ce6e0
----

The `causallyConsistent` property is optional and defaults to `true`. This ensures that operations within the session are causally ordered.

The session ID is returned in the `Location` header. Extract the last part of the URL path to get the session ID:

[source]
----
sid=11c3ceb6-7b97-4f34-ba3f-689ea22ce6e0
----

==== Using a Session

To execute requests within a session, add the `sid` query parameter:

[source,http]
----
POST /collection?sid=11c3ceb6-7b97-4f34-ba3f-689ea22ce6e0 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Session example",
  "value": 42
}
----

[source,http]
----
GET /collection?sid=11c3ceb6-7b97-4f34-ba3f-689ea22ce6e0 HTTP/1.1
----

=== Transaction Lifecycle

Transactions provide an all-or-nothing execution model. Either all operations in the transaction succeed, or none of them take effect.

==== Transaction Status

A transaction can be in one of the following states:

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Status |Description
|`IN` |Transaction is in progress
|`COMMITTED` |Transaction has been successfully committed
|`ABORTED` |Transaction has been aborted (explicitly or due to error/timeout)
|===

==== Starting a Transaction

To start a transaction within a session:

[source,http]
----
POST /_sessions/11c3ceb6-7b97-4f34-ba3f-689ea22ce6e0/_txns HTTP/1.1
----

Response:

[source,http]
----
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: http://localhost:8080/_sessions/11c3ceb6-7b97-4f34-ba3f-689ea22ce6e0/_txns/1
----

The transaction ID is the last part of the Location header (in this case, `1`).

==== Checking Transaction Status

To check the current status of a transaction:

[source,http]
----
GET /_sessions/11c3ceb6-7b97-4f34-ba3f-689ea22ce6e0/_txns HTTP/1.1
----

Response:

[source,http]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "currentTxn": {
    "id": 1,
    "status": "IN"
  }
}
----

==== Executing Operations in a Transaction

To include operations in a transaction, use both the `sid` and `txn` query parameters:

[source,http]
----
POST /accounts?sid=11c3ceb6-7b97-4f34-ba3f-689ea22ce6e0&txn=1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "owner": "Alice",
  "balance": 1000
}
----

[source,http]
----
PATCH /accounts/bob?sid=11c3ceb6-7b97-4f34-ba3f-689ea22ce6e0&txn=1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "$inc": { "balance": -100 }
}
----

[source,http]
----
PATCH /accounts/alice?sid=11c3ceb6-7b97-4f34-ba3f-689ea22ce6e0&txn=1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "$inc": { "balance": 100 }
}
----

==== Committing a Transaction

When all operations have been executed successfully, commit the transaction:

[source,http]
----
PATCH /_sessions/11c3ceb6-7b97-4f34-ba3f-689ea22ce6e0/_txns/1 HTTP/1.1
----

Response:

[source,http]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
----

==== Aborting a Transaction

If you need to cancel a transaction:

[source,http]
----
DELETE /_sessions/11c3ceb6-7b97-4f34-ba3f-689ea22ce6e0/_txns/1 HTTP/1.1
----

Response:

[source,http]
----
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
----

=== Error Handling

[WARNING]
====
The client application is responsible for handling transaction errors and implementing appropriate retry logic.
====

Common error scenarios:

[cols="1,1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Error |Status Code |Description
|Transaction not in progress |406 |An operation was attempted in a transaction that's not in the "IN" state
|Write conflict |409 |Another transaction committed changes to the same documents
|Transaction expired |500 |Transaction exceeded the maximum runtime (default: 60 seconds)
|===

==== Transaction Timeouts

By default, transactions must complete within 60 seconds. If this time limit is exceeded, MongoDB automatically aborts the transaction.

For more information on transaction limits, see the https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/transactions-production-consideration/#runtime-limit[MongoDB documentation].

  "amount": 100,
  "timestamp": { "$date": 1623408052123 }
}
----
+
[source,http]
----
HTTP/1.1 201 Created

=== Best Practices

. *Keep transactions short and simple*
+
Limit the number of operations in a transaction to reduce the chance of conflicts and timeouts.

. *Implement proper error handling and retry logic*
+
Be prepared to handle transaction errors and retry when appropriate.

. *Avoid operations that require talking to all shards*
+
In sharded clusters, transactions that span multiple shards have higher latency and risk of failures.

. *Create indexes before running transactions*
+
Unindexed queries in transactions can cause performance issues.

. *Consider increasing the default transaction timeout*
+
For complex operations, you may need to configure MongoDB to allow longer transactions.

=== Limitations

* Multi-document transactions have some performance overhead
* Transactions in sharded clusters have additional constraints
* Some operations are not allowed in transactions (e.g., creating collections or indexes)
* Default 60-second runtime limit (can be configured)
