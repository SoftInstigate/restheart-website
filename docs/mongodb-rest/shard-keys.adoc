== Working with Shard Keys

=== What are Shard Keys?

In a MongoDB sharded cluster, data is distributed across multiple servers (shards) to support horizontal scaling. The *shard key* is the field (or fields) that determines how MongoDB distributes the documents of a collection across these shards.

The shard key determines how MongoDB partitions data across a cluster and directly impacts performance, scalability, and query efficiency.

=== Accessing Documents in Sharded Collections

When working with sharded collections via RESTHeart, you need to be aware of how the shard key affects document retrieval.

==== When to Specify the Shard Key

When a sharded collection uses:

* A shard key that is different from the `_id` field
* A compound shard key (consisting of multiple fields)

You *must* include the `shardkey` query parameter in your requests to retrieve individual documents.

==== How to Specify the Shard Key

Add the `shardkey` query parameter to your request, providing a JSON document containing the shard key fields:

[source,http]
----
GET /db/collection/documentId?shardkey={"fieldName":value} HTTP/1.1
----

For compound shard keys, include all fields that make up the key:

[source,http]
----
GET /db/collection/documentId?shardkey={"field1":value1,"field2":value2} HTTP/1.1
----

=== Examples

==== Example 1: Simple Shard Key

If a collection is sharded on field `region`:

[source,http]
----
GET /db/customers/5ac9f95563445900062144aa?shardkey={"region":"EU"} HTTP/1.1
----

==== Example 2: Compound Shard Key

If a collection is sharded on fields `region` and `type`:

[source,http]
----
GET /db/customers/5ac9f95563445900062144aa?shardkey={"region":"EU","type":"premium"} HTTP/1.1
----

=== Common Issues

==== Missing Shard Key

If you don't provide the shard key when required, MongoDB might return an error or be unable to locate the document efficiently.

[source,http]
----
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
----

==== Incorrect Shard Key Values

Providing incorrect values for the shard key will likely result in document not being found:

[source,http]
----
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
----

=== Best Practices

. *Understand your shard key* - Know which fields are used as shard keys in your collections
. *Include all fields* for compound shard keys
. *Consider including the shard key in all write operations* to improve performance
. *Choose appropriate shard keys* when designing your database for optimal data distribution
