This section describes the REST API that allows you to interact with MongoDB using standard HTTP methods.

> Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. RESTful web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations.

=== RESTHeart MongoDB REST API

__RESTHeart provides a complete REST API for MongoDB__ that allows you to create, read, update, and delete documents using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).

With RESTHeart you can __build modern applications that interact with MongoDB through a RESTful interface__, without writing backend code. The API follows REST principles and uses JSON for data exchange.

For example, to retrieve documents from the `inventory` collection, simply send a GET request to `http://mydomain.com/inventory`. To create a new document, POST your JSON data to the same URI.

The REST API eliminates the need for custom backend code for common database operations, allowing you to focus on building your application's frontend.

=== Key Features

* **Standard HTTP Methods**: Use GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE to interact with your data
* **JSON Documents**: Work with JSON representations of MongoDB documents
* **Query Documents**: Filter, sort, project, and paginate results using query parameters
* **Aggregations**: Execute MongoDB aggregation pipelines via REST
* **Bulk Operations**: Insert, update, or delete multiple documents in a single request
* **GridFS Support**: Store and retrieve binary files
* **Transactions**: Execute multiple operations atomically
* **JSON Schema Validation**: Enforce data structure and validation rules
* **ETags for Concurrency Control**: Prevent conflicts with optimistic locking

=== API Resources

RESTHeart exposes MongoDB resources through intuitive URIs:

* **Databases**: `/{db}` - Create, delete, or get information about a database
* **Collections**: `/{db}/{collection}` - Create, delete, or query collections
* **Documents**: `/{db}/{collection}/{id}` - Create, read, update, or delete specific documents
* **Aggregations**: `/{db}/{collection}/_aggrs/{aggregation}` - Execute predefined aggregation pipelines
* **File Buckets**: `/{db}/{bucket}.files` - Store and retrieve files using GridFS
* **Indexes**: `/{db}/{collection}/_indexes` - Manage collection indexes
* **Sessions**: `/{db}/_sessions` - Manage transactions

=== Getting Started

The best way to learn the REST API is through hands-on examples:

1. **link:/docs/mongodb-rest/tutorial[Tutorial]** - Start here to learn the basics through simple examples
2. **link:/docs/mongodb-rest/read-docs[Reading Documents]** - Learn about querying, filtering, sorting, and pagination
3. **link:/docs/mongodb-rest/write-docs[Writing Documents]** - Master creating, updating, and deleting documents
4. **link:/docs/mongodb-rest/aggregations[Aggregations]** - Run powerful aggregation pipelines via REST

=== How It Works

RESTHeart acts as a REST API server that sits between your application and MongoDB:

[source]
----
Client Application → HTTP/REST → RESTHeart → MongoDB Protocol → MongoDB
----

Your application makes standard HTTP requests to RESTHeart, which translates them into MongoDB operations. Responses are returned as JSON documents.

=== Authentication and Security

RESTHeart includes built-in authentication and authorization:

* **Multiple Authentication Mechanisms**: Basic Auth, JWT tokens, and more
* **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Fine-grained permissions for resources
* **MongoDB Roles Integration**: Leverage existing MongoDB user roles
* **Request Predicates**: Control access based on request properties

See the link:/docs/security/overview[Security documentation] for details.
