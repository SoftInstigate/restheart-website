== Validating Documents with JSON Schema

RESTHeart provides robust document validation capabilities through JSON Schema, allowing you to enforce structure and data quality in your MongoDB collections.

=== Introduction

Data validation ensures that documents conform to a predefined structure before they're stored in the database. RESTHeart supports two complementary approaches to validation:

1. *MongoDB's built-in schema validation*: Available in MongoDB 3.6+ using JSON Schema
2. *RESTHeart's jsonSchema Interceptor*: A more flexible approach with additional features

The jsonSchema Interceptor in RESTHeart offers several advantages over MongoDB's native validation:

* Schemas are stored in a dedicated schema store (`/_schemas`) and are validated themselves
* Schemas can be reused across multiple collections
* Support for complex schemas with sub-schemas using the `$ref` keyword
* Integration with online schemas
* Performance optimization through schema caching

=== Understanding JSON Schema

JSON Schema is a vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents. It provides a contract for what JSON data is required for a given application and how it can be modified.

[quote]
____
JSON Schema specifies a JSON-based format to define the structure of JSON data for validation, documentation, and interaction control.
____

JSON Schema lets you define:

* Required and optional fields
* Field types (string, number, object, etc.)
* Value constraints (minimum, maximum, pattern, etc.)
* Nested object structures
* Array validations

=== Setting Up Schema Validation

==== Step 1: Create the Schema Store

First, create a schema store to hold your JSON Schema definitions:

[source,http]
----
PUT /_schemas HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
----

==== Step 2: Define a Schema

Create a schema document that defines the structure for your data:

[source,http]
----
PUT /_schemas/address?wm=upsert HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "address": { "type": "string" },
    "city": { "type": "string" },
    "postal-code": { "type": "string" },
    "country": { "type": "string"}
  },
  "required": ["address", "city", "country"]
}

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
----

This schema defines an address format that requires the address, city, and country fields.

NOTE: RESTHeart automatically generates an `id` property for the schema (not to be confused with the `_id` field).

[source,http]
----
GET /_schemas/address HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "id": "https://schema-store/restheart/address#",
  "_id": "address",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "address": { "type": "string" },
    "city": { "type": "string" },
    "postal-code": { "type": "string" },
    "country": { "type": "string"}
  },
  "required": ["address", "city", "country"]
}
----

==== Step 3: Apply the Schema to a Collection

To enforce the schema on a collection, update the collection's metadata:

[source,http]
----
PUT /addresses HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "jsonSchema": {
    "schemaId": "address"
  }
}

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
----

The collection metadata's `jsonSchema` property has the following options:

[cols="1,3,1", options="header"]
|===
|Property |Description |Required
|`schemaId` |The _id of the JSON schema to enforce |Yes
|`schemaStoreDb` |The database containing the schema |No (defaults to current database)
|===

=== Validating MongoDB BSON Types

MongoDB uses BSON (Binary JSON) which supports additional data types not available in standard JSON. To validate these types, you can define schema definitions for BSON types.

==== Example: Defining BSON Types Schema

[source,http]
----
PUT /_schemas/bson HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "_id": "bson",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "definitions": {
    "date": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "$date": { "type": "number" }
      },
      "additionalProperties": false
    },
    "objectid": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "$oid": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "additionalProperties": false
    }
  }
}

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
----

==== Using BSON Types in Schemas

You can reference these BSON type definitions in other schemas using the `$ref` keyword:

[source,http]
----
PUT /_schemas/post HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "_id": "post",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "_id": { "$ref": "http://schema-store/restheart/bson#/definitions/objectid" },
    "_etag": { "$ref": "http://schema-store/restheart/bson#/definitions/objectid" },
    "title": { "type": "string" },
    "content": { "type": "string" },
    "published": { "type": "boolean" },
    "publishDate": { "$ref": "http://schema-store/restheart/bson#/definitions/date" }
  },
  "required": ["title", "content"]
}

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
----

=== Testing the Validation

Let's see validation in action by attempting to create both valid and invalid documents.

==== Trying to Create an Invalid Document

[source,http]
----
POST /addresses HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "address": "Via D'Annunzio 28"
}

HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "http status code": 400,
  "http status description": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Request content violates schema 'address': 2 schema violations found, required key [city] not found, required key [country] not found"
}
----

The request is rejected because it's missing required fields defined in the schema.

==== Creating a Valid Document

[source,http]
----
POST /addresses HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "address": "Via D'Annunzio, 28",
  "city": "L'Aquila",
  "country": "Italy",
  "postal-code": "67100"
}

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
----

This document passes validation because it includes all required fields with the correct data types.

=== Advanced Schema Features

==== Composite Schemas

You can create complex validation rules by combining schemas:

[source,json]
----
{
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "#/definitions/address" },
    { "$ref": "#/definitions/contact" }
  ]
}
----

==== Conditional Validation

Apply different validation rules based on document properties:

[source,json]
----
{
  "if": {
    "properties": { "type": { "enum": ["business"] } }
  },
  "then": {
    "required": ["taxId", "companyName"]
  },
  "else": {
    "required": ["firstName", "lastName"]
  }
}
----

=== Limitations

The jsonSchema validator has some limitations to be aware of:

* *Bulk Operations*: By default, the validator doesn't support bulk PATCH requests:

[source,http]
----
PATCH /addresses/*?filter={"country":"Italy"} HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{ "updated": true }

HTTP/1.1 501 Not Implemented
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "http status code": 501,
  "http status description": "Not Implemented",
  "message": "'jsonSchema' checker does not support bulk PATCH requests. Set 'skipNotSupported:true' to allow them."
}
----

To allow bulk PATCH operations without validation, add the `skipNotSupported` metadata property:

[source,http]
----
PATCH /addresses HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "jsonSchema": {
    "schemaId": "address",
    "skipNotSupported": true
  }
}

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
----

=== Best Practices

1. *Start simple*: Begin with basic schemas and refine them as your application evolves
2. *Reuse common patterns*: Use `$ref` to reference shared definitions
3. *Test thoroughly*: Verify both valid and invalid document scenarios
4. *Use descriptive error messages*: Set `errorMessage` properties to guide users
5. *Leverage additional keywords*: Explore pattern, minimum/maximum, and other constraints for precise validation
6. *Document your schemas*: Include descriptions for fields to generate helpful documentation
