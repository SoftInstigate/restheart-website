layout: docs-adoc
title: Test asciidoc
---

This is a sample page composed in AsciiDoc.
Jekyll converts it to HTML using http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor].

== Intro

This jekyll template with asciidoc

== Github pages

As long as I understood, github pages don't support adoc natively.

However there is a github action that allow rendering asciidoc to html.

== The cool code

The problem is that the code is not very readable.

[source,java]
----
public class Cool {
    private boolean cool;

    public Cool(){
        this.cool = true;
    }
}
