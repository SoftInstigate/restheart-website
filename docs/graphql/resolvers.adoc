Custom resolvers provide advanced flexibility in how GraphQL fields are resolved in RESTHeart. This guide covers resolver types, implementation patterns, and best practices.

=== Understanding Resolvers

In RESTHeart GraphQL, Type resolvers determine concrete types for interfaces and unions

=== Interface Type Resolvers

Type resolvers for interfaces determine which concrete type a document represents:

[source,json]
----
{
    "mappings": {
        "Content": {
            "$typeResolver": {
                "Article": "field-exists(wordCount)",
                "Video": "field-exists(duration)",
                "Podcast": "field-exists(audioUrl)"
            }
        }
    }
}
----

=== Union Type Resolvers

Similar to interfaces, but for union types:

[source,json]
----
{
    "mappings": {
        "SearchResult": {
            "$typeResolver": {
                "User": "field-exists(email)",
                "Product": "field-exists(price)",
                "Article": "field-exists(content)"
            }
        }
    }
}
----

=== Type Resolution Rules

1. *Evaluation Order*
- Rules are evaluated in order
- First matching rule determines the type
- Include a default case when possible

2. *Available Functions*
- `field-exists(fieldName)`: Checks if a field exists
- `field-equals(fieldName, value)`: Compares field value
- `field-type(fieldName, type)`: Checks field data type

[source,json]
----
{
    "mappings": {
        "Node": {
            "$typeResolver": {
                "Document": "field-type(content, string)",
                "Image": "field-equals(type, 'image')",
                "Default": "true"
            }
        }
    }
}
