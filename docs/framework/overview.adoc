== What Are Plugins?

RESTHeart is ready to go as soon as you install and configure it, with comprehensive MongoDB API and security functionality built-in. For many standard web applications, these basic features are sufficient.

These functionalities are provided by **standard plugins** distributed with RESTHeart in the `./plugins` directory:

[source,bash]
----
plugins
├── lib/                         # Plugin dependencies
├── restheart-graphql.jar       # GraphQL API
├── restheart-metrics.jar       # Metrics and monitoring
├── restheart-mongoclient-provider.jar  # MongoDB connection
├── restheart-mongodb.jar        # REST API for MongoDB
├── restheart-polyglot.jar       # JavaScript/TypeScript support
└── restheart-security.jar       # Authentication & Authorization
----

Developing **custom plugins** is how you extend RESTHeart with your own business logic. You can develop plugins in **Java**, **Kotlin**, or **JavaScript**.

== Plugin Types

RESTHeart supports 4 types of plugins, each serving a specific purpose:

[cols="1,3,2", options="header"]
|===
|Type |Purpose |Example Use Cases

|**Services**
|Add web endpoints to handle HTTP requests
|REST APIs, GraphQL endpoints, file uploads, custom business logic

|**Interceptors**
|Monitor and modify requests/responses at different lifecycle stages
|Logging, validation, data transformation, adding headers

|**Initializers**
|Execute initialization logic at startup
|Database setup, loading reference data, starting background tasks

|**Providers**
|Supply objects to other plugins via dependency injection
|Database connections, shared utilities, configuration objects
|===

TIP: You can also extend the security layer with specialized security plugins. See link:/docs/framework/authentication-mechanisms[Authentication Mechanisms], link:/docs/framework/authenticators[Authenticators], link:/docs/framework/authorizers[Authorizers], and link:/docs/framework/token-managers[Token Managers].

== Learning Path

We recommend learning plugin development in this order:

1. **Start here:** link:/docs/framework/tutorial[Plugin Development Tutorial] - Build your first plugin step-by-step
2. **Understand the basics:** This page (you are here) - Core concepts and setup
3. **Deep dive by type:**
   - link:/docs/framework/services[Services] - Build web endpoints
   - link:/docs/framework/interceptors[Interceptors] - Modify request/response flow
   - link:/docs/framework/initializers[Initializers] - Startup initialization
   - link:/docs/framework/providers[Providers] - Dependency injection
4. **Deploy:** link:/docs/framework/deploy[Deploy Plugins] - Package and deploy your plugins
5. **Advanced:** link:/docs/framework/javascript-plugins[JavaScript Plugins] - Use JavaScript/TypeScript

== Quick Start: Plugin Skeleton

The fastest way to start is with our plugin skeleton project:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:SoftInstigate/restheart-plugin-skeleton.git
$ cd restheart-plugin-skeleton
$ ./mvnw clean package
$ docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v ./target:/opt/restheart/plugins/custom softinstigate/restheart -s
----

Test the example service:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl localhost:8080/srv
{"message":"Hello World!","rnd":"njXZksfKFW"}
----

TIP: Check the link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart-plugin-skeleton/blob/master/README.md[skeleton repository README] and browse the link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/tree/master/examples[official plugin examples] for more code samples.

== Understanding Plugin Development

Before diving into building plugins, you should understand some core concepts:

**Essential concepts** (recommended for all developers):

- **@RegisterPlugin annotation** - How RESTHeart discovers and configures your plugin
- **Configuration** - How to configure plugins via `restheart.yml`  
- **Dependency Injection** - How to access MongoDB, configuration, and other services
- **Request/Response Types** - Understanding type safety and content handling

➡️ **Read:** link:/docs/framework/core-concepts[Plugin Core Concepts]

**When you're ready to code:**

- Start with link:/docs/framework/tutorial[Plugin Development Tutorial] for hands-on practice
- Then explore specific plugin types: link:/docs/framework/services[Services], link:/docs/framework/interceptors[Interceptors], link:/docs/framework/initializers[Initializers], link:/docs/framework/providers[Providers]

== Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics, follow this learning path:

1. **Understand the concepts:** link:/docs/framework/core-concepts[Core Concepts] - Essential knowledge before coding

2. **Hands-on practice:** Complete the link:/docs/framework/tutorial[Plugin Development Tutorial] to build your first working plugin

3. **Learn each plugin type:**
   - link:/docs/framework/services[Services] - Create REST endpoints
   - link:/docs/framework/interceptors[Interceptors] - Modify request/response flow  
   - link:/docs/framework/initializers[Initializers] - Run startup logic
   - link:/docs/framework/providers[Providers] - Create injectable dependencies

4. **Deploy your plugins:** link:/docs/framework/deploy[Deployment Guide]

5. **Explore examples:** Browse link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/tree/master/examples[official examples on GitHub]

The only required dependency to develop a plugin is `restheart-commons`.

With maven:

[source,xml]
