=== Overview

RESTHeart Cloud provides a flexible and secure user management system that allows you to create, manage, and control access to your API resources through the `/users` and `/acl` collections.

=== User Document Structure

In RESTHeart Cloud, a user document requires only three fields:

* `_id`: The username (used as the document identifier)
* `password`: The user's password (automatically encrypted by RESTHeart)
* `roles`: Array of role names assigned to the user

Example of a minimal valid user document:

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "john_doe",
    "roles": [ "reader", "writer" ],
    "password": "SecurePassword123!"
}
----

You can include additional fields like `email`, `active`, or any custom properties as needed, but they are not required by the system.

=== Creating Users

You can create users using the `/users` collection with the temporary JWT token.

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST https://[your-instance].restheart.com/users \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer [your-temporary-token]" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
         "_id": "john_doe",
         "password": "SecurePassword123!",
         "roles": ["reader", "writer"],
         "email": "john@example.com"
     }'
----

NOTE: The password is automatically encrypted by RESTHeart when stored in MongoDB.

=== Roles and Permissions

==== Understanding Role-Based Access Control

RESTHeart Cloud uses a role-based permission system where:

1. Each user is assigned one or more roles (in the `roles` array)
2. Permissions are defined in `/acl` documents that specify what actions are allowed for each role
3. The `admin` role is configured as the root role by default (has full access)

You can define any custom roles (like `reader`, `writer`, `manager`, etc.) and grant them specific permissions using the ACL collection.

==== Permission Structure

Permissions in RESTHeart Cloud follow the format defined by the `mongoAclAuthorizer`. Each permission document contains:

* `_id`: Unique identifier for the permission
* `roles`: Array of roles this permission applies to
* `predicate`: Condition that determines when this permission applies
* `priority`: Numeric value determining precedence (higher values have higher priority)
* `mongo`: Optional object with MongoDB-specific permissions

==== Creating Permissions

Here's an example of creating a basic permission:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST https://[your-instance].restheart.com/acl \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer [your-temporary-token]" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
         "_id": "project-manager-permission",
         "roles": ["project_manager"],
         "predicate": "path-prefix[\"/projects\"] and (method[GET] or method[POST] or method[PUT])",
         "priority": 100,
         "mongo": {
             "readFilter": {"department": "engineering"},
             "writeFilter": {"department": "engineering"}
         }
     }'
----

==== Advanced Permission Examples

===== Data Filtering Based on User

This permission allows users to see only their own data:

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "users-see-own-data",
    "roles": ["user"],
    "predicate": "path-prefix[\"/data\"] and method[GET]",
    "priority": 100,
    "mongo": {
        "readFilter": { "owner": "@user._id" }
    }
}
----

===== Auto-adding User ID to Created Documents

This permission ensures that when a user creates a document, their ID is automatically added as the owner:

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "users-create-own-data",
    "roles": ["user"],
    "predicate": "path-prefix[\"/data\"] and method[POST]",
    "priority": 100,
    "mongo": {
        "mergeRequest": { "owner": "@user._id" }
    }
}
----

=== Managing Users

==== Updating Users

Update user information or roles:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X PATCH https://[your-instance].restheart.com/users/john_doe \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer [your-temporary-token]" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
         "roles": ["admin"],
         "email": "john.updated@example.com"
     }'
----

==== Deleting Users

Remove a user from the system:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X DELETE https://[your-instance].restheart.com/users/john_doe \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer [your-temporary-token]"
----

=== Common Permission Patterns

==== Path-based Access Control

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "writers-full-access",
    "roles": ["writer"],
    "predicate": "path-prefix[\"/content\"] and (method[GET] or method[POST] or method[PUT] or method[PATCH])",
    "priority": 100
}
----

==== Method-based Restrictions

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "readers-read-only",
    "roles": ["reader"],
    "predicate": "method[GET]",
    "priority": 100
}
----

==== Property-level Permissions

Hide sensitive fields from the response:

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "hide-sensitive-data",
    "roles": ["reader"],
    "predicate": "path-prefix[\"/users\"] and method[GET]",
    "priority": 100,
    "mongo": {
        "projectResponse": { "password": 0, "secretNotes": 0 }
    }
}
----

=== Security Considerations

* Passwords are automatically encrypted with bcrypt
* Temporary tokens have limited lifespans
* Role-based access control with ACL permissions
* Request predicates control precise access patterns
* Document-level security through readFilter and writeFilter
* All user management actions are logged

=== Best Practices

* Always use strong, unique passwords
* Assign users the minimum required roles (principle of least privilege)
* Create granular permissions with specific predicates
* Use `readFilter` to control data visibility
* Use `mergeRequest` to enforce ownership
* Use higher priority values for more specific permissions
* Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions

=== Troubleshooting

* *Permission Denied*: Check that the user has the correct roles and that a permission exists for those roles
* *Can't Access Data*: Verify there are no `readFilter` restrictions limiting visibility
* *Unexpected Content*: Check for `mergeRequest` permissions that might be modifying data
* *Authentication Failed*: Ensure the username and password are correct
