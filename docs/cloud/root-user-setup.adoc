== What This Setup Does

This wizard will:

1. *Create a root user* with your chosen credentials
2. *Set up full permissions* allowing all operations on your instance
3. *Test the authentication* to ensure everything works correctly

WARNING: *Security Notice*: The root user has complete access to your instance. Choose strong credentials and keep them secure.

=== Step 1: Create Root User

==== cURL

[source,bash]
----
curl -X PUT [INSTANCE-URL]/users/root \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [JWT]"
  -d '{"password": "[YOUR-PASSWORD]"}'
----

==== HTTPie

[source,bash]
----
http PUT [INSTANCE-URL]/users/root \
  Authorization:"Bearer [JWT]" password=[YOUR-PASSWORD]
----

==== JavaScript

[source,javascript]
----
const response = await fetch('[INSTANCE-URL]/users/root', {
  method: 'PUT',
  body: JSON.stringify({ "password": "[YOUR-PASSWORD]" }),
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer [JWT]'
  }
});
----

=== Step 2: Set Up Admin Permissions

The admin permission (`/_acl/rootCanDoEverything`) grants full access to all endpoints and operations. This permission uses:

- *Predicate*: `path-prefix('/')` - Matches all paths
- *Roles*: `["root"]` - Applied to users with the root role
- *Priority*: `0` - High priority permission
- *MongoDB Options*: Enables all management operations

== Next Steps

Once your root user is set up, you can:

1. *Create additional users* with specific roles and permissions
2. *Set up collections* for your application data
3. *Configure roles and permissions* for different user types
