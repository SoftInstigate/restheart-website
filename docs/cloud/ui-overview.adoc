The RESTHeart Cloud management console is a web-based UI that lets you manage every aspect of your RESTHeart service instance — without writing a single API call. Each UI feature maps directly to an underlying RESTHeart REST API capability.

Access the console at https://cloud.restheart.com and navigate to your service to get started.

== Feature Areas

The Cloud UI covers nine integrated feature areas:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Feature | What you can do

| link:managing-data[**Collections & Documents**]
| Browse, create, edit, and delete collections and documents. Detect GridFS buckets. Assign JSON Schema validators.

| link:managing-users[**User Management**]
| Create and manage the users that authenticate against your service via Basic Auth or Token Auth.

| link:managing-permissions[**Permissions (ACL)**]
| Define role-based access control rules using Undertow predicates and optional MongoDB-level filters.

| link:aggregations[**Aggregations**]
| Define server-side MongoDB aggregation pipelines, test them inline, and expose them as REST endpoints.

| link:../cloud/webhook/[**Webhooks**]
| Fire HTTP callbacks or send emails in response to API events. Enable and manage the webhooks plugin.

| link:graphql[**GraphQL**]
| Create and manage GraphQL application definitions that map MongoDB collections to a GraphQL schema.

| link:schemas[**JSON Schema Validation**]
| Manage reusable JSON Schema documents and assign them to collections as document validators.

| link:change-streams[**WebSocket Change Streams**]
| Define and test server-side MongoDB Change Stream endpoints exposed as WebSocket connections.

| link:plans[**Plan Comparison**]
| Understand the differences between Free/Shared and Dedicated service tiers and how they affect the UI.

== Service Tiers

The UI adapts its behaviour based on the service tier your instance runs on.

=== Free / Shared

* Single-database services.
* The UI operates directly on the default database — no database selector is shown.
* System collections (`users`, `acl`, `gql-apps`) are available at their root paths (e.g. `/users`, `/acl`).

=== Dedicated

* Multi-database services.
* A **database selector** dropdown appears before any collection-level operation, letting you switch between databases. The collection list, aggregation list, and stream list all refresh automatically when a new database is selected.
* System collections are scoped under `/restheart/` (e.g. `/restheart/users`, `/restheart/acl`, `/restheart/gql-apps`).

See link:plans[Dedicated vs. Free/Shared Plans] for a complete side-by-side comparison.

== Admin JWT

All management operations performed by the Cloud UI use a short-lived **Admin JWT** token issued by the RESTHeart Cloud control plane.

* The token is injected automatically as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every API call the UI makes to your service instance.
* It is separate from the end-user credentials stored in the `users` collection and has broader administrative permissions.
* You do **not** need to manage this token yourself — the UI handles its lifecycle, including renewal when it expires.

NOTE: The Admin JWT cannot be used to authenticate WebSocket Change Stream connections. Only regular users registered in the `users` collection can authenticate WebSocket connections. See link:change-streams#authentication[Change Streams — Authentication] for details.

== Common UI Behaviours

These conventions apply consistently across all feature areas.

=== Confirmation Dialogs

Every destructive operation — deleting a collection, document, user, permission, aggregation, stream, webhook, or schema — requires explicit confirmation via a modal dialog before executing. There are no silent deletes.

=== Search and Pagination

All list views implement:

* **Debounced search** — 300 ms delay before firing; works client-side or server-side depending on the feature.
* **Configurable page size** — choose how many rows to display per page.
* **Previous / next navigation** — with total page count displayed.

=== JSON Editing

All JSON-capable fields share a consistent editing experience:

* Syntax-aware textarea with a monospace font.
* A **Format** button that pretty-prints valid JSON and reports an error on invalid input.
* Inline validation errors surfaced before the save action is allowed.

=== Error Handling

HTTP errors from the RESTHeart API are surfaced as toast notifications. The UI picks the most specific error message available from the response body, falling back through `exception.message.errmsg` → `exception.message` → `message` → a generic fallback string.

== Next Steps

* link:getting-started[Getting Started Guide] — sign up, create a service, and set up your root user.
* link:managing-data[Managing Collections & Documents] — start browsing your MongoDB data.
* link:managing-users[Managing Users] — create the users that will access your service.
* link:managing-permissions[Managing Permissions (ACL)] — control what each role can do.
