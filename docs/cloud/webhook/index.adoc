=== Real-Time Event Integration

The Webhook Plugin enables real-time event notifications from RESTHeart to external services. When requests match your conditions, webhooks automatically trigger, sending data to any HTTP endpoint.

=== What It Does

The plugin intercepts HTTP requests and responses, evaluates configurable conditions, and sends webhook notifications when conditions match. Transform payloads using Mustache templates to match any third-party API format—no code deployment needed.

=== Key Features

*Flexible Conditions*: Match requests using MongoDB-style predicates for paths, methods, status codes, and content.

*Payload Transformation*: Use Mustache templates to reshape data into any format required by target APIs like Slack, Mailjet, or custom webhooks.

*Execution Logs*: View complete request/response flow with transformation details for easy debugging.

*Simple Management*: Configure, test, and monitor webhooks through the web interface with real-time validation.

=== Common Use Cases

Send Slack notifications when critical events occur. Trigger email campaigns via Mailjet or SendGrid when users register. Stream audit logs to external services for compliance. Sync data across microservices automatically. Connect to analytics platforms, CRM systems, or custom integrations.

=== Getting Started

Enable the Webhook Plugin in your RESTHeart Cloud service, create a webhook with a condition like `path('/users') and method('POST')`, specify a target URL, optionally add a transformation template, and you're done. Webhooks trigger automatically as your API processes requests.
