Get your backend running in under 5 minutes! This guide will walk you through creating your first API instance and demonstrate how RESTHeart Cloud accelerates development. Each API instance provides a single database with collections that you'll create to build your application.

=== Prerequisites

* A web browser
* An email address
* Optional: curl, Postman, or any HTTP client for testing

=== Step 1: Sign Up

. Navigate to https://cloud.restheart.com
. Click "Sign Up" or "Create Account"
. Enter your email address and create a strong password
. Verify your email address through the confirmation link

=== Step 2: Create Your First API Instance

. Log in to your RESTHeart Cloud dashboard
. Click "Create New API"
. Choose your desired plan:
   * **Free**: Perfect for learning and prototyping
   * **Shared**: For small to medium applications
   * **Dedicated**: Production-ready with dedicated resources
. Select a geographical region (e.g., EU Central, US East)
. Provide an optional name for your API instance
. Click "Create"

⏱️ **Your API will be ready in seconds!**

Your API instance gets a unique endpoint:
`[instanceid].[region]-[tier].restheart.com`

Example: `f2d222.eu-central-1-free-1.restheart.com`

=== Understanding API Instances

Each API instance in RESTHeart Cloud provides:

* **One Database**: The root URL (`/`) represents your single database
* **One User Base**: The `/users` collection stores all authentication information
* **One ACL Set**: The `/acl` collection defines all permissions
* **Isolated Environment**: Complete separation from other instances

IMPORTANT: Create separate API instances for separate applications. If you're building multiple applications, don't try to share a single API instance between them. Each application should have its own API instance with its own users, permissions, and data collections.

=== Step 3: Obtain Temporary JWT Token

. In the API instance dashboard
. Navigate to the "Security" or "Setup" section
. Click "Generate Setup Token"
. Copy the generated JWT token securely

WARNING: This token has administrative privileges and expires quickly. Use it only for initial setup.

=== Step 4: Create Your First Collections

Unlike traditional databases where you need to create a database first, in RESTHeart Cloud:

* Each API instance already has a single database at the root path (`/`)
* You only need to create collections directly under the root
* Each application should have its own API instance

Let's create collections for a simple task management system:

[source,bash]
----
# Create a 'tasks' collection in your database
curl -X PUT https://[your-instance].restheart.com/tasks \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer [your-temporary-token]"

# Create a 'categories' collection
curl -X PUT https://[your-instance].restheart.com/categories \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer [your-temporary-token]"
----

🎉 **That's it!** You now have fully functional collections with REST endpoints in your database.

=== Step 5: Add Your First Task

Insert a task document:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST https://[your-instance].restheart.com/tasks \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer [your-temporary-token]" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
         "title": "Learn RESTHeart Cloud",
         "description": "Complete the getting started tutorial",
         "status": "in-progress",
         "priority": "high",
         "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
     }'
----

=== Step 5.1: Query Your Data

RESTHeart automatically provides powerful querying capabilities:

[source,bash]
----
# Get all tasks
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [your-temporary-token]" \
     https://[your-instance].restheart.com/tasks

# Get high-priority tasks only
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [your-temporary-token]" \
     "https://[your-instance].restheart.com/tasks?filter={'priority':'high'}"

# Get tasks sorted by creation date
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [your-temporary-token]" \
     "https://[your-instance].restheart.com/tasks?sort={'createdAt':-1}"
----

=== Step 6: Set Up User Authentication

Each API instance has its own user management system in the reserved `/users` collection:

[source,bash]
----
# Create a task manager user
curl -X POST https://[your-instance].restheart.com/users \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer [your-temporary-token]" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
         "_id": "taskmanager",
         "password": "SecurePassword123!",
         "email": "manager@company.com",
         "roles": ["task-manager"]
     }'

# Create a regular user
curl -X POST https://[your-instance].restheart.com/users \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer [your-temporary-token]" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
         "_id": "developer",
         "password": "AnotherSecurePass456!",
         "email": "dev@company.com",
         "roles": ["task-user"]
     }'
----

=== Step 7: Configure Permissions

Set up role-based access control using the reserved `/acl` collection:

[source,bash]
----
# Task managers can do everything
curl -X POST https://[your-instance].restheart.com/acl \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer [your-temporary-token]" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
         "_id": "task-manager-full-access",
         "roles": ["task-manager"],
         "predicate": "path-prefix[\"/tasks\"]",
         "priority": 100
     }'

# Regular users can only read and create tasks
curl -X POST https://[your-instance].restheart.com/acl \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer [your-temporary-token]" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
         "_id": "task-user-limited-access",
         "roles": ["task-user"],
         "predicate": "path-prefix[\"/tasks\"] and (method[GET] or method[POST])",
         "priority": 100
     }'
----

=== Step 8: Test User Authentication

Now test with your newly created users:

[source,bash]
----
# Login as taskmanager (full access)
curl -X GET https://[your-instance].restheart.com/tasks \
     -u taskmanager:SecurePassword123!

# Login as developer (limited access)
curl -X GET https://[your-instance].restheart.com/tasks \
     -u developer:AnotherSecurePass456!
----

=== 🚀 What You've Accomplished

In just a few minutes, you've built a complete backend with:

* ✅ **API Instance**: Your own dedicated RESTHeart environment
* ✅ **Collections**: Ready to store your application data
* ✅ **REST API**: Full CRUD operations with advanced querying
* ✅ **User Management**: Secure authentication system via `/users`
* ✅ **Access Control**: Role-based permissions via `/acl`
* ✅ **Production-Ready**: HTTPS, encrypted data, monitoring

=== When to Create Another API Instance

Create separate API instances for:

* **Different Applications**: Each application should have its own API instance
* **Separate Environments**: Development, staging, and production
* **Client Projects**: Separate instances for different clients
* **Isolation Requirements**: When you need separate user bases or permissions

Each API instance provides:
* Single database at root path (`/`)
* Dedicated user management (`/users` collection)
* Dedicated permission system (`/acl` collection)
* Separate monitoring and usage metrics

=== Next Level: Real-Time Features

Add WebSocket support for real-time task updates:

[source,bash]
----
# Create a change stream for real-time updates
curl -X POST https://[your-instance].restheart.com/_streams/task-updates \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer [your-temporary-token]" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
         "uri": "ws://[your-instance].restheart.com/_streams/task-updates",
         "stages": [
             {"$match": {"ns.coll": "tasks"}},
             {"$project": {"_id": 1, "operationType": 1, "fullDocument": 1}}
         ]
     }'
----

Now any changes to tasks will be broadcast in real-time to connected WebSocket clients!

=== Best Practices for Production

* **Security**: Rotate tokens regularly and use strong passwords
* **Performance**: Implement proper indexing for frequently queried fields
* **Monitoring**: Use the dashboard to track API usage and performance
* **Backup**: Enable automatic backups for production data
* **Scaling**: Start with Free/Shared and upgrade to Dedicated as you grow

    const response = await fetch('https://[your-instance].restheart.com/tasks', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Authorization': 'Basic ' + base64.encode('developer:AnotherSecurePass456!'),
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(task)
    });
    return response.json();
};
----
