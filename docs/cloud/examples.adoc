            "status": "published",
            "endDate": {"$gte": {"$date": "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z"}}
          }
        }
      }'

# Add public events
curl -X POST https://[instance].restheart.com/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "API Workshop: Building with RESTHeart",
    "description": "Learn how to build powerful APIs using RESTHeart Cloud",
    "startDate": "2024-01-25T14:00:00Z",
    "endDate": "2024-01-25T16:00:00Z",
    "location": {
      "type": "online",
      "url": "https://meet.example.com/workshop"
    },
    "status": "published",
    "category": "workshop",
    "maxAttendees": 50,
    "currentAttendees": 12,
    "tags": ["api", "workshop", "development"],

  }'

===== Public Access Examples

[source,bash]
----
# Public users can access these without authentication

# Get upcoming events
curl "https://[instance].restheart.com/events?sort={startDate:1}"

# Filter events by category
curl "https://[instance].restheart.com/events?filter={'category':'workshop'}"

# Get events for a specific date range
curl "https://[instance].restheart.com/events?filter={'startDate':{\$gte:'2024-01-20T00:00:00Z',\$lt:'2024-01-27T00:00:00Z'}}"
----

===== Security Considerations for Public Access

[source,bash]
----
# Best practices for public collections:

# 1. Use specific read filters to limit exposed data
# 2. Never allow write access for $unauthenticated role

# Example: Limit fields exposed to public users
curl -X PUT https://[instance].restheart.com/acl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "role": "$unauthenticated",
        "predicate": "method(GET) and path('/events')",
        "mongo": {
          "readFilter": {"public": true},
          "projectResponse": {
            "username": 1,
            "displayName": 1,
            "avatar": 1,
            "joinedAt": 1
          }
        }
      }'

  -d '{
    "tenantId": "acme-corp",
    "name": "ACME Corporation",
    "plan": "professional",
    "status": "active",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    "settings": {
      "maxUsers": 50,
      "maxStorage": "10GB",
      "features": ["analytics", "integrations", "priority-support"]
    },
    "billing": {
      "email": "billing@acme.com",
      "address": "123 Business St, City, State 12345"
    }
  }'

curl -X POST https://[instance].restheart.com/usage \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tenantId": "acme-corp",
    "date": "2024-01-15",
    "metrics": {
      "apiCalls": 1250,
      "storageUsed": "2.5GB",
      "activeUsers": 23,
      "dataTransfer": "150MB"
    },
    "breakdown": {
      "endpoints": {
        "/api/users": 450,
        "/api/projects": 320,
        "/api/tasks": 480
      }
    }
  }'

=== Performance and Optimization

==== Caching Strategy
[source,bash]
----
# Enable caching for frequently accessed data
curl -X PUT https://[instance].restheart.com/products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "cachePolicy": {
      "enabled": true,
      "ttl": 300,
      "invalidateOn": ["POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE"]
    }
  }'
----

==== Indexing for Performance
[source,bash]
----
# Create indexes for better query performance
curl -X PUT https://[instance].restheart.com/products/_indexes/category-price \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "keys": {"category": 1, "price": -1},
    "options": {"name": "category_price_idx"}
  }'

# Text index for search
curl -X PUT https://[instance].restheart.com/products/_indexes/text-search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "keys": {"name": "text", "description": "text", "tags": "text"},
    "options": {"name": "product_text_search"}
  }'

=== Next Steps

These examples demonstrate the power and flexibility of RESTHeart Cloud across different domains. To implement any of these solutions:

1. **Start with the Free tier** to experiment and prototype
2. **Adapt the data models** to fit your specific requirements
3. **Implement proper security** with user roles and permissions
4. **Add real-time features** using WebSocket change streams
5. **Scale up** to Shared or Dedicated tiers as your application grows
