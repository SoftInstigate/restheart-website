=== Cloud UI — Management Console

The RESTHeart Cloud UI is a web-based management console that lets you manage every aspect of your service instance without writing a single API call. The following pages document each feature area:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Page | Description

| link:ui-overview[**UI Overview**]
| Introduction to the management console, service tier differences, Admin JWT, and cross-cutting UI behaviours (search, pagination, JSON editing, error handling).

| link:managing-data[**Collections & Documents**]
| Browse, create, edit, and delete collections and documents. GridFS bucket detection. Assign JSON Schema validators from the Collection Browser.

| link:managing-users[**User Management**]
| Create and manage the users that authenticate against your service via Basic Auth or Token Auth. Password hashing, roles, search, and pagination.

| link:managing-permissions[**Permissions (ACL)**]
| Define role-based access control rules using Undertow predicates. Configure row-level security, field masking, and request merging via `mongo` options.

| link:aggregations[**Aggregation Pipelines**]
| Define server-side MongoDB aggregation pipelines, test them with the inline execution panel, expose them as REST endpoints, and use pipeline variables via `$var` / `avars`.

| link:webhooks[**Webhooks**]
| Fire HTTP callbacks or send emails in response to API events. Enable/disable the webhooks plugin, manage HTTP and email webhook types, and view execution logs.

| link:graphql[**GraphQL Applications**]
| Create and manage GraphQL app definitions that map MongoDB collections to a GraphQL schema. Visual Editor and JSON Editor modes. Enable/disable individual apps.

| link:schemas[**JSON Schema Validation**]
| Manage reusable JSON Schema documents (draft-07) stored in `/_schemas`. Assign schemas to collections as document validators from the Collection Browser.

| link:change-streams[**WebSocket Change Streams**]
| Define server-side MongoDB Change Stream endpoints exposed as WebSocket connections. Built-in Live Try panel, authentication via Basic Auth in the WebSocket URL.

| link:plans[**Dedicated vs. Free/Shared Plans**]
| Side-by-side comparison of plan differences: database selector, system collection paths, and UI behaviour variations by tier.
