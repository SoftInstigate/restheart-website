== What is RESTHeart?

RESTHeart is a framework for building cloud-native HTTP microservices. It's designed for the JVM and optimized for GraalVM, using Java Virtual Threads for high-performance concurrent processing.

**The key insight:** RESTHeart has two faces, and understanding this distinction is crucial:

=== RESTHeart as a Ready-to-Use Platform

Out of the box, RESTHeart provides complete MongoDB APIs that work immediately:

* **REST API** - Full CRUD operations, queries, aggregations, transactions
* **GraphQL API** - Flexible queries with automatic MongoDB integration  
* **WebSocket API** - Real-time data with change streams
* **Security** - Built-in authentication and authorization

**No coding required.** You can build complete applications using just HTTP requests and configuration.

=== RESTHeart as an HTTP Framework

RESTHeart is also a powerful framework for building custom services:

* Develop plugins in **Java**, **Kotlin**, **JavaScript**, or **TypeScript**
* Four simple building blocks: Services, Interceptors, Providers, Initializers
* Starts in ~100 milliseconds for fast development cycles
* Each request runs in a dedicated virtual thread (simple, scalable code)
* Powerful dependency injection

**Write custom code** when you need functionality beyond the standard MongoDB APIs.

== How RESTHeart Works

=== Architecture

RESTHeart consists of:

1. **restheart-core** - The runtime process that:
   - Parses configuration
   - Registers plugins
   - Enforces security policies
   - Routes requests to services
   - Executes interceptors

2. **Standard Plugins** - Pre-built functionality in the `plugins` directory:

[source,bash]
----
plugins
├── lib/                         # Plugin dependencies
├── restheart-graphql.jar       # GraphQL API
├── restheart-metrics.jar       # Metrics and monitoring
├── restheart-mongoclient-provider.jar  # MongoDB connection
├── restheart-mongodb.jar        # REST API for MongoDB
├── restheart-polyglot.jar       # JavaScript/TypeScript support
└── restheart-security.jar       # Authentication & Authorization
----

3. **Your Custom Plugins** (optional) - Add JAR files or JavaScript directories

== Who Should Use RESTHeart?

=== You Need a MongoDB API (No Coding)

**Use case:** Build mobile apps, web apps, or integrations that need to access MongoDB.

**What you'll use:**
- Part 2: MongoDB REST API
- Part 3: GraphQL & WebSocket APIs  
- Part 4: Security
- Part 5: Configuration & Deployment

**Example:** A mobile app that needs CRUD operations, user authentication, and real-time updates.

=== You're Building Custom HTTP Services

**Use case:** Build microservices with custom business logic.

**What you'll use:**
- Part 6: Framework (Plugin Development)
- Part 7: Security Plugins (if needed)

**Example:** An HTTP API that processes payments, sends emails, or integrates with third-party services.

=== You Need Both

**Use case:** Use the MongoDB API for data operations, plus custom services for business logic.

**What you'll use:** Everything!

**Example:** An e-commerce platform using the MongoDB API for products/orders, plus custom services for payment processing and inventory management.

== Why RESTHeart?

=== Speed and Ease

RESTHeart prioritizes speed and simplicity. It's built with high-quality libraries to provide a seamless developer experience.

=== Virtual Threads for Superior Performance

RESTHeart fully embraces virtual threads, the groundbreaking feature introduced in Java 21. Virtual threads deliver remarkable performance and efficiency improvements:

- Faster execution
- Lower memory footprint
- Simpler concurrent code
- Better resource utilization

This keeps RESTHeart at the forefront of high-performance, scalable frameworks.

=== Instant APIs Out of the Box

For many applications, you just need:
- **Data access** - REST/GraphQL/WebSocket APIs for MongoDB
- **Security** - Authentication and authorization  
- **Configuration** - Connect to your database

> Most applications require exactly this. Run a stock RESTHeart instance with zero code!

TIP: Check the link:/docs/mongodb-rest/demo-webapp.html[demo Web Chat application, window=_blank]. It requires *zero* lines of backend code.

=== Built for Developers

When you need custom functionality, RESTHeart makes plugin development simple:

**Hello World in Java:**

[source,java]
----
@RegisterPlugin(name = "greetings", description = "just another Hello World")
public class GreeterService implements JsonService {
    @Override
    public void handle(JsonRequest request, JsonResponse response) {
        response.setContent(object().put("message", "Hello World!"));
    }
}
----

**Hello World in JavaScript:**

[source,javascript]
----
export const options = { name: "greetings", description: "just another Hello World" }

export function handle(request, response) {
    response.setContent(JSON.stringify({ msg: 'Hello World' }));
    response.setContentTypeAsJson();
}
----

NOTE: JavaScript runs in a thread-safe, multi-threading environment. No async/await, promises, or callbacks required. *Just clean, simple code.*

=== Key Features

* **Declarative Security** - Configure authentication and authorization without code
* **Instant MongoDB APIs** - REST, GraphQL, and WebSocket
* **Polyglot** - Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, TypeScript
* **High Performance** - Hundreds of thousands of requests per second
* **Cloud-Ready** - Docker, Kubernetes, GraalVM native images
* **Fully Extensible** - Simple plugin system

== What Makes RESTHeart Different?

RESTHeart is similar to frameworks like _Undertow_ (which RESTHeart uses internally), _Vert.x_, _Quarkus_, _Spring Boot_, and _Node.js_.

**The difference:** RESTHeart includes application-level features, not just framework primitives.

* **Other frameworks** require you to implement authentication, database access, API design, security
* **RESTHeart** provides these features ready to use, and lets you customize when needed

== Deployment Options

RESTHeart runs anywhere Java runs:

* **Standalone JAR** - `java -jar restheart.jar`
* **Docker** - `docker run softinstigate/restheart`
* **Kubernetes** - Deploy with standard manifests
* **GraalVM Native** - ~40MB native binary, instant startup
* **Cloud Platforms** - AWS, GCP, Azure

== Licensing

RESTHeart is dual-licensed:

* **AGPL** - Free and open source (no feature restrictions)
* **Enterprise License** - Business-friendly license for closed-source products
