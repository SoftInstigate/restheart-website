== Docker Images in RESTHeart v9

RESTHeart v9 consolidates Docker images from three variants to two for simplified deployment:

[cols="2,3,2,2"]
|===
|**Image**|**Description**|**Startup**|**Memory**

|**`softinstigate/restheart:latest`**
|GraalVM-based image with full plugin support (JAR and JavaScript)
|2-3 seconds
|~256MB minimum

|**`softinstigate/restheart:latest-native`**
|Native binary optimized for Kubernetes (JavaScript plugins only)
|<100ms
|~64MB minimum
|===

**Key Changes from v8:**

- ❌ **Removed**: OpenJDK-based image (replaced by GraalVM)
- ✅ **Default**: GraalVM image is now the standard (`latest` tag)
- ✅ **Native**: Optimized for Kubernetes deployments
- ✅ **Full plugins**: Dynamic JAR and JavaScript plugin loading by default

**Why This Change?**

GraalVM now provides performance and size parity with OpenJDK while offering:
- Full plugin functionality enabled by default
- Better long-term support and performance
- Unified image for most deployment scenarios

**Which Image Should I Use?**

- **`latest`** - For most deployments, development, and when you need to load custom JAR plugins
- **`latest-native`** - For Kubernetes, serverless, or when you need the fastest possible startup and lowest memory footprint

IMPORTANT: The native image only supports JavaScript plugins. If you need custom Java/Kotlin plugins, use the GraalVM-based `latest` image or build a custom native image.

== Which Docker Setup Should I Use?

Choose based on your needs:

[cols="2,3,2"]
|===
|**Setup**|**Use Case**|**Complexity**
|**Docker Compose** (Recommended)|Most users - includes MongoDB|⭐ Easy
|Standalone|Developing custom plugins only|⭐ Easy
|MongoDB on localhost|RESTHeart in Docker, MongoDB outside|⭐⭐ Moderate
|Network isolated|Production-like security setup|⭐⭐⭐ Advanced
|Development (open MongoDB)|Testing with external MongoDB tools|⭐⭐ Moderate
|===

**If you're unsure, use Docker Compose.**

=== Run with docker compose

NOTE: This is the quickest way to run RESTHeart.

To run both RESTHeart and MongoDB services you can use `docker compose`. Just copy and paste the following shell command:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/master/docker-compose.yml --output docker-compose.yml && docker compose up --attach restheart
----


=== Run RESTHeart with Docker in standalone mode


Standalone mode runs RESTHeart without MongoDB. Learn more about link:/docs/foundations/setup#what-is-standalone-mode[when to use standalone mode].

[source,bash]
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -e RHO="/fileRealmAuthenticator/users[userid='admin']/password->'secret';/http-listener/host->'0.0.0.0'" softinstigate/restheart -s

NOTE: the `RHO` environment variable sets the password for the user `admin`.
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -e RHO="/fileRealmAuthenticator/users[userid='admin']/password->'secret';/http-listener/host->'0.0.0.0'" softinstigate/restheart -s

NOTE: the `RHO` environment variable sets the password for the user `admin`.

=== Run RESTHeart with Docker, MongoDB running on localhost

This runs RESTHeart with Docker connecting to MongoDB running on the localhost.

If MongoDB is not already running, the following command will start a replica set and initiate it (the replica set is not required but enables RESTHeart to support transactions and change streams). Note that the data path is `/tmp/db`.

[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir -p /tmp/db && mongod --fork --syslog --replSet=foo -dbpath=/tmp/db && mongosh --quiet --eval 'if (!rs.isMaster().ismaster) rs.initiate();'
----

Run RESTHeart with:

[.text-muted]
On OSX and Windows:

[source,bash]
$ docker run --rm -p "8080:8080" softinstigate/restheart

[.text-muted]
On Linux

[source,bash]
$ docker run --rm -p "8080:8080" --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway softinstigate/restheart

NOTE: This command relies on the docker support of `host.docker.internal`. If you are using an old docker version or a docker runtime that does not support it, than you need to configure the docker network accordingly (you can refer to the brilliant link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24319662/from-inside-of-a-docker-container-how-do-i-connect-to-the-localhost-of-the-mach["From inside of a Docker container, how do I connect to the localhost of the machine?" on StackOverflow]) or use one of the an alternative methods described in the further sections.

## Run RESTHeart and network isolated MongoDB with Docker

This setup uses a RESTHeart container connecting to a MongoDB container via a private Docker network. This ensures network isolation, with the RESTHeart API as the only entry point. The containers communicate securely within their dedicated network, while external access is controlled through the RESTHeart API


=== Understanding This Setup

This configuration uses a **Docker network** to isolate RESTHeart and MongoDB:

- Both containers communicate via a private network
- Only RESTHeart's port (8080) is exposed to your host machine
- MongoDB is not directly accessible from outside the Docker network
- This mimics a production security model

**Use this setup for:**
- Learning production deployment patterns
- Testing security configurations
- Development environments needing network isolation

### Setup Procedure

You only need to complete this setup once. Follow these steps:

1) **Create a Docker Network**

Create a dedicated network for RESTHeart and MongoDB communication:

[source,bash]
$ docker network create restheart-network

2) **Start MongoDB Container**

Launch a MongoDB container within the created network:

[source,bash]
$ docker run -d --name mongodb --network restheart-network mongo --replSet=rs0

3) **Initialize MongoDB as a Single Node Replica Set**

Initialize the MongoDB instance to work as a single node replica set:

[source,bash]
$ docker run -it --network restheart-network --rm mongo mongosh --host mongodb --quiet --eval "rs.initiate()"

4) **Launch RESTHeart Container**

Run the RESTHeart container, linking it to the MongoDB container:

[source,bash]
$ docker run --name restheart --rm --network restheart-network -p "8080:8080" -e RHO='/http-listener/host->"0.0.0.0";/mclient/connection-string->"mongodb://mongodb"' softinstigate/restheart


**Command breakdown:**
- `--network restheart-network` - Connects to the isolated network
- `-p "8080:8080"` - Exposes RESTHeart's API port
- `--rm` - Automatically removes container on stop (stateless)
- `-e RHO='...'` - Configures MongoDB connection string to use hostname `mongodb` (the container name)

5) **Test the Setup**

Execute a test request to verify that RESTHeart is running:

[source,bash]
----
$ http -b http://localhost:8080/ping
# Expected Output: Greetings from RESTHeart!
----

### Stopping the Containers

To stop both RESTHeart and MongoDB containers, use the following command:

[source,bash]
$ docker stop restheart mongodb

### Restarting the Containers

The RESTHeart container is stateless and is removed upon stopping (due to the `--rm` option). However, the MongoDB container retains its state and is not removed on stop. To restart, use the following commands:

1) **Start MongoDB Container**

[source,bash]
$ docker start mongodb

2) **Run RESTHeart Container**

[source,bash]
$ docker run --name restheart --rm --network restheart-network -p 8080:8080 -e RHO='/http-listener/host->"0.0.0.0";/mclient/connection-string->"mongodb://mongodb"' softinstigate/restheart

### How to connect to MongoDB with mongosh

[source,bash]
$ docker run -it --network restheart-network --rm mongo mongosh --host mongodb

## For development: run RESTHeart and open MongoDB with Docker

WARNING: This setup is insecure and should be only used for developing or testing purposes.

### Setup Procedure

You only need to complete this setup once. Follow these steps:

1) **Start MongoDB Container**

Launch a MongoDB container:

[source,bash]
$ docker run -d --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 mongo --replSet=rs0

2) **Initialize MongoDB as a Single Node Replica Set**

Initialize the MongoDB instance to work as a single node replica set:

[source,bash]
$ docker exec mongodb mongosh --quiet --eval "rs.initiate()"

3) **Launch RESTHeart Container**

Run the RESTHeart container, linking it to the MongoDB container:

[source,bash]
$ docker run --name restheart --rm -p "8080:8080" softinstigate/restheart

4) **Test the Setup**

Execute a test request to verify that RESTHeart is running:

[source,bash]
----
$ http -b http://localhost:8080/ping
# Expected Output: Greetings from RESTHeart!
----

### Stopping the Containers

To stop both RESTHeart and MongoDB containers, use the following command:

[source,bash]
$ docker stop restheart mongodb

### Restarting the Containers

The RESTHeart container is stateless and is removed upon stopping (due to the `--rm` option). However, the MongoDB container retains its state and is not removed on stop. To restart, use the following commands:

1) **Start MongoDB Container**

[source,bash]
$ docker start mongodb

2) **Run RESTHeart Container**

[source,bash]
$ docker run --name restheart --rm -p "8080:8080" softinstigate/restheart

### Run RESTHeart with custom plugin

If the plugin jar file is in the directory `./target`, this command starts RESTHeart with the plugin integrated:

[source,bash]
$ docker run --name restheart --rm -p "8080:8080" -v ./target:/opt/restheart/plugins/custom softinstigate/restheart

NOTE: This command requires RESTHeart version equal or greater than 7.7.

**How this works:**
- `-v ./target:/opt/restheart/plugins/custom` mounts your local `./target` directory
- RESTHeart scans `/opt/restheart/plugins/` on startup
- Your plugin JAR files in `./target` will be loaded automatically

**Requirements:**
- Plugin JAR must be in `./target` on your host machine
- RESTHeart version must be >= 7.7

### Run RESTHeart with remote debugging

This runs RESTHeart enabling remote debugging (port 4000).

[source,bash]
$ docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 4000:4000 --entrypoint "java" softinstigate/restheart -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=0.0.0.0:4000 -jar restheart.jar

### How to connect to MongoDB with mongosh

[source,bash]
$ docker exec -it mongodb mongosh

=== The RESTHeart Docker tags

RESTHeart Docker images come in four different versions:


==== Which Docker Tag Should I Use?

**For most users:** Use `latest` (the standard image)

**Choose a different tag if:**
- You need JavaScript plugins → Use `latest-graalvm`
- You need smallest image size → Use `latest-distroless`
- You're deploying to Kubernetes → Use `latest-native`
- You need a specific version → Use version tags like `8.1.5`

==== Docker Tag Reference
- Standard multi-arch (FROM softinstigate/graalvm)
- native (FROM debian:12.6-slim)

These are example tags:

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|**Tag**|**Example**|**Description**
|`<version>`|`latest`, `9`, `9.0`, `9.0.0`|**The standard image.**  This is usually the one you want to use. `docker pull softinstigate/restheart:latest`
|`<version>-native`|`latest-native`, `9-native`, `9.0-native`, `9.0.0-native` | RESTHeart built as a native binary. It is the smallest image with lightning-fast startup time. This is the perfect choice for deploying in a Kubernetes cluster. It can only execute JavaScript plugins. Check out link:/docs/plugins/deploy#deploy-java-plugins-on-restheart-native[Deploy Java plugins on RESTHeart Native] for more info. `docker pull softinstigate/restheart:latest-native`
|===

NOTE: The native image does not support Java plugins. However, you can build your own RESTHeart executable that embeds your plugins. Check the link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart-plugin-skeleton/[RESTHeart Plugin Skeleton] for more information.

=== Dockerfile

- link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/core/Dockerfile[Dockerfile]
- link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/core/Dockerfile.native[Dockerfile.native]

The "distroless" images are for special deployment requirements, where having the smallest possible image size and the very minimal security attack surface is required and their tag contains a `distroless` label. You usually don't need these images unless you exactly know what you are doing.

Images tags ending with `-native` are created with the link:https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/[GraalVM Native Image technology] starting from stable builds of the product, especially suited for high demanding environments, like Kubernetes. These are experimental and not fully documented yet, please contact us for questions.
