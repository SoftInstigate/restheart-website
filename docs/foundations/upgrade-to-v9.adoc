=== Details

==== Java 25 LTS Migration

RESTHeart v9 requires Java 25 LTS, released on September 16, 2025.

Note that Java 25 is a Long-Term Support (LTS) release.

**Key Changes:**

- Updated to Java 25 across the entire codebase
- GraalVM configuration refactored from separate config files to unified `reachability-metadata.json` format
- Updated `undertow-core` and `wildfly-common` versions for Java 25 native image compatibility
- Docker base image updated to `eclipse-temurin:25-jre`
- Upgraded `Dockerfile.graalvm` to version 25-graalce

==== Consolidate Docker Images to GraalVM Only

RESTHeart v9 consolidates Docker image distribution from three variants to two, eliminating the OpenJDK variant.

**New Image Strategy:**

1. **`softinstigate/restheart:latest`** (GraalVM-based)
   - Supports dynamic JAR and JavaScript plugin loading
   - ~256MB minimum RAM
   - 2-3 second startup time
   - Complete plugin functionality enabled by default

2. **`softinstigate/restheart:latest-native`** (Native binary)
   - Optimized for Kubernetes environments
   - ~64MB minimum RAM
   - <100ms startup time
   - JavaScript-only plugin support

**Benefits:**

- Reduced maintenance overhead
- Eliminated user confusion regarding image selection
- Improved default plugin functionality
- Maintained optimization for Kubernetes deployments

==== Enhanced RESTHeart Plugin Logging

RESTHeart v9 introduces comprehensive debug-level logging across all plugin types for improved observability.

**Enhanced Logging Coverage:**

- Interceptors (pre-auth, post-auth, post-request, async post-request)
- Services, Providers, Initializers
- Authentication Mechanisms, Authenticators, Authorizers, Token Managers

**Key Features:**

- Tree-style visual log grouping for better readability
- Tracing IDs added to log messages for request tracking
- Reusable security handlers to reduce redundant initialization logs
- Logs moved to TRACE level to reduce DEBUG-level verbosity
- Fixed alignment and visual grouping of authentication/authorization logs

This enhancement makes it easier to:

- Debug issues in the request processing pipeline
- Monitor performance and identify bottlenecks
- Understand authentication and authorization decisions
- Troubleshoot interceptor chains

==== Distributed Tracing Headers Support

RESTHeart v9 simplifies distributed tracing integration by automatically displaying configured tracing headers in request logs without requiring custom Logback configuration.

**Problems Addressed:**

Previously, displaying tracing headers in logs required:
1. Custom Logback configuration files
2. Manual pattern modifications with MDC variables
3. Additional setup friction for teams integrating with tracing systems

**New Approach:**

Simply configure the headers you want to track in `restheart.yml`:

[source,yml]
----
logging:
  tracing-headers:
    - x-b3-traceid      # Zipkin
    - x-request-id      # Custom
    - uber-trace-id     # Jaeger
----

**Key Features:**

- Automatic display of all configured tracing headers in logs
- Echo captured headers back in HTTP responses
- Fallback to auto-generated trace IDs when headers are absent
- Headers remain accessible in SLF4J MDC for custom logging
- Performance-optimized with cached HttpString instances

**Log Output:**

When tracing headers are present:

[source,text]
----
[x-b3-traceid: 7f8a3d2c, x-request-id: abc123] ⚬ GET http://localhost:8080/ping => status=200 elapsed=56ms
----

When no headers are present (fallback):

[source,text]
----
[trace-id: 0001] ⚬ GET http://localhost:8080/ping => status=200 elapsed=56ms
----

**Benefits:**

- Zero custom configuration required
- Seamless integration with Zipkin, Jaeger, and OpenTelemetry
- First configured header becomes primary trace ID
- Request correlation across distributed systems
- No performance overhead for requests without headers

See the link:/docs/deployment/auditing[Auditing documentation] for complete configuration details.

==== Custom Metrics Support for Monitoring Plugin

RESTHeart v9 extends the monitoring plugin to allow registration and collection of custom application-specific metrics.

**Supported Metric Types:**

- **Counter** - Monotonically increasing values (e.g., requests processed)
- **Gauge** - Current value that can increase or decrease (e.g., queue size)
- **Histogram** - Distribution of values (e.g., request durations)
- **Summary** - Similar to histogram with configurable quantiles

**Usage Example:**

[source,java]
----
@RegisterPlugin(
    name = "customMetricsInit",
    description = "Registers custom metrics",
    enabledByDefault = true)
public class CustomMetricsInitializer implements Initializer {
    @Override
    public void init() {
        // Register a counter
        Metrics.registerCounter(
            "custom_requests_total",
            "Total number of custom requests",
            "endpoint", "method"
        );
        
        // Register a gauge
        Metrics.registerGauge(
            "cache_size",
            "Current cache size",
            () -> getCacheSize()
        );
    }
}
----

**Key Features:**

- Register metrics at startup using Initializers
- Update metrics during request handling in Services/Interceptors
- Expose metrics at `/metrics` endpoint in Prometheus format
- Support for custom labels
- Configuration via `restheart.yml`

==== Refactor Cache Implementation from AsyncLoadingCache to LoadingCache

RESTHeart v9 migrates from Caffeine's `AsyncLoadingCache` to `LoadingCache`.

**Rationale:**

With recent Java improvements, blocking operations no longer pin virtual threads to platform threads, eliminating the original need for the async variant.

**Benefits:**

- Reduced overhead from unnecessary virtual thread creation
- Simpler, more straightforward codebase
- Improved performance with less context switching
- Enhanced debugging and reasoning about synchronous operations
- Proper virtual thread release during blocking operations

==== GraalVM Native Image Support

RESTHeart is now officially listed on GraalVM's framework compatibility page as a tested framework that fully supports native image compilation.

**Implementation Highlights:**

- Automatic reflection configuration of plugins for native images
- Streamlined plugin development for native builds
- Unified reachability metadata configuration format
- Explicit initialization of PluginsClassloader for native image execution

==== CORS Headers Optimization

RESTHeart v9 implements CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers following the principle of least privilege, using minimal defaults that services can extend as needed.

**Default CORS Headers:**

RESTHeart provides secure, minimal defaults for CORS headers:

- **Allow Headers**: `Authorization`, `Content-Type`, `X-Requested-With`, `No-Auth-Challenge`
- **Expose Headers**: Empty by default - services explicitly declare what they expose
- **Allow Methods**: `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`
- **Allow Origin**: `*` (any origin)
- **Allow Credentials**: `true`

**Customizing CORS Behavior:**

Services customize CORS behavior by overriding methods in the `CORSHeaders` interface:

- **`accessControlExposeHeaders()`** - Declares which response headers are exposed to browser clients
- **`accessControlAllowMethods()`** - Specifies HTTP methods supported by the service
- **`accessControlAllowHeaders()`** - Lists which request headers are allowed
- **`accessControlAllowOrigin()`** - Restricts allowed origins (defaults to `*`)
- **`corsEnabled()`** - Disables CORS entirely for internal APIs

**Example - Service exposing response headers:**

[source,java]
----
@RegisterPlugin(
    name = "resourceService",
    description = "Service that creates resources")
public class ResourceService implements JsonService {
    @Override
    public void handle(JsonRequest req, JsonResponse res) {
        if (req.isPost()) {
            var id = createResource(req.getContent());
            res.getHeaders().add(HttpString.tryFromString("Location"), 
                "/resources/" + id);
            res.setStatusCode(HttpStatus.SC_CREATED);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public String accessControlExposeHeaders() {
        // Make Location header accessible to browser clients
        return "Location, ETag";
    }
}
----

**Key Point:**

Response headers like `Location`, `ETag`, or custom headers are not accessible to browser JavaScript unless explicitly exposed via `accessControlExposeHeaders()`. Services that set such headers must override this method.

See the link:/docs/plugins/cors[CORS Handling documentation] for complete details and examples.

==== Improve Aggregation Pipeline Security with Stage and Operator Blacklisting

RESTHeart v9 addresses a security gap where dangerous MongoDB operators could bypass protections when used in aggregation pipelines.

**Security Controls:**

1. **Stage-Level Blocking** - Restricts dangerous pipeline stages:
   - `$out` - Writing to collections
   - `$merge` - Merging data into collections
   - `$lookup` - Cross-collection joins
   - `$graphLookup` - Graph traversal operations
   - `$unionWith` - Combining collections

2. **Operator-Level Blocking** - Prevents JavaScript-executing operators:
   - `$where` - JavaScript filter expressions
   - `$function` - Custom JavaScript functions
   - `$accumulator` - JavaScript-based aggregation

3. **Cross-Database Validation** - Ensures lookup operations only reference collections in the same database

4. **JavaScript Execution Control** - Comprehensive blocking of all JavaScript-executing operators

**Configuration Example:**

[source,yml]
----
mongo:
  aggregationSecurity:
    blacklistedStages:
      - $out
      - $merge
      - $lookup
      - $graphLookup
      - $unionWith
    blacklistedOperators:
      - $where
      - $function
      - $accumulator
    allowCrossDatabaseOperations: false
    allowJavaScriptExecution: false
----

**Error Handling:**

Security violations return HTTP 403 Forbidden with specific violation types:

- `BLACKLISTED_STAGE`
- `BLACKLISTED_OPERATOR`
- `CROSS_DATABASE_ACCESS`
- `CROSS_DATABASE_OUTPUT`
- `JAVASCRIPT_EXECUTION`

**Note:** Feature is enabled by default with conservative settings.

==== Remove Deprecated Map-Reduce Pipeline Type

RESTHeart v9 eliminates support for MongoDB's map-reduce pipeline functionality.

**Breaking Change:** Users must migrate to aggregation pipelines before upgrading to v9.

**Rationale:**

- MongoDB deprecated map-reduce starting in version 5.0
- Map-reduce aggregations are inherently difficult to secure
- RESTHeart maintained this feature through v7 and v8 for backward compatibility
- Reduces code complexity and maintenance burden

==== Cleanup Bad Request Response from MongoService

RESTHeart v9 simplifies error responses when MongoDB requests fail due to invalid request bodies.

**Before:**

[source,json]
----
{
  "exception": "org.restheart.exchange.BadRequestException",
  "exception message": "Invalid JSON. JSON reader was expecting a value but found 'x1'.",
  "http status code": 400,
  "http status description": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Invalid JSON. JSON reader was expecting a value but found 'x1'."
}
----

**After:**

[source,json]
----
{
  "http status code": 400,
  "http status description": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Invalid JSON. JSON reader was expecting a value but found 'x1'."
}
----

The response now contains only essential information without redundant exception metadata.

==== Simplify GraphQL App Descriptor

RESTHeart v9 streamlines the GraphQL App Description document structure in MongoDB.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Remove `descriptor.name`** - The `_id` field becomes the sole identifier
2. **Make `descriptor.uri` optional** - Auto-generates URIs following pattern `/{_id}` when omitted
3. **Enforce string type for `_id`** - Required when no custom URI is specified
4. **Prevent URI collisions** - Validation prevents `_id` values from matching existing URIs and vice versa

**Minimal Configuration Example:**

[source,json]
----
{
  "_id": "user-api"
}
----

This automatically generates the URI `/user-api`.

**Custom URI Example:**

[source,json]
----
{
  "_id": "user-api",
  "descriptor": {
    "uri": "/v1/users"
  }
}
----

**Migration:** Remove `descriptor.name` from existing GraphQL app definition documents.

==== Simplify Authentication with OAuth 2.0-Compatible /token Endpoint

RESTHeart v9 replaces the approach of allowing authentication on any secure endpoint with dedicated `/token` endpoints following OAuth 2.0 conventions.

**Problems Addressed:**

1. **Security concerns** - Token generation was possible on any endpoint (e.g., `/users?set-auth-cookie`)
2. **Performance issues** - TokenInjector ran on EVERY authenticated request with 2-5ms cache lookup overhead
3. **Design clarity** - Previous system was non-intuitive and violated REST principles

**New Endpoints:**

1. **POST /token**
   - OAuth 2.0-style endpoint
   - Supports HTTP Basic Auth and form-based credentials
   - Returns `access_token`, `token_type`, and `expires_in`

2. **POST /token/cookie**
   - Sets HttpOnly cookies without exposing tokens in response bodies
   - Enhanced security for browser-based applications

**Example Request:**

[source,bash]
----
# Using Basic Auth
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/token \
  -u username:password

# Using form data (OAuth 2.0 style)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=password&username=admin&password=secret"
----

**Example Response:**

[source,json]
----
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 900
}
----

**Performance Improvement:**

85% performance improvement for token-based authentication (347ms → 50ms for 100 requests)

**Configuration Changes:**

- Default JWT authentication is now enabled
- RND tokens are disabled by default
- Cookie handlers are enabled by default

==== Add `REQUEST_AFTER_FAILED_AUTH` InterceptPoint

RESTHeart v9 introduces a new intercept point that activates when authentication or authorization fails.

**Use Cases:**

- Protection against brute force attacks
- Customized error responses for auth failures
- Security event logging
- Rate limiting based on failed attempts

**Example Implementation:**

[source,java]
----
@RegisterPlugin(
    name = "failedAuthLogger",
    description = "Logs failed authentication attempts",
    interceptPoint = InterceptPoint.REQUEST_AFTER_FAILED_AUTH)
public class FailedAuthLoggerInterceptor implements WildcardInterceptor {
    @Override
    public void handle(Request<?> request, Response<?> response) throws Exception {
        var account = request.getAuthenticatedAccount();
        var clientIp = request.getRemoteAddress();
        
        if (account == null) {
            LOGGER.warn("Authentication failed from IP: {}", clientIp);
        } else {
            LOGGER.warn("Authorization failed for user: {} from IP: {}", 
                account.getPrincipal(), clientIp);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public boolean resolve(Request<?> request, Response<?> response) {
        return true; // Intercept all failed auth attempts
    }
}
----

The intercept point executes after auth failures but before sending error responses to clients, allowing custom handling and logging.

==== Add Request Body Predicates

RESTHeart v9 implements support for `@request.body` variables in the ACL predicate system.

**Key Features:**

- Access to complete request bodies and nested properties via dot notation
- Array element indexing (e.g., `@request.body.roles.0`)
- Support for BsonRequest, JsonRequest, and MongoRequest types
- Integration with Undertow comparison operators: `equals()`, `greater-than()`, `less-than()`, `regex()`

**Configuration Example:**

[source,yml]
----
permissions:
  - role: user
    predicate: >
      path-prefix('/transactions') and 
      method(POST) and 
      less-than(@request.body.amount, 1000)
----

This example restricts users to creating transactions with amounts less than 1000.

**Nested Property Access:**

[source,yml]
----
permissions:
  - role: user
    predicate: >
      path-prefix('/orders') and 
      equals(@request.body.payment.method, 'credit_card')
----

**Notable Behavior:**

Missing properties and non-JSON/BSON requests resolve to `null`, implementing fail-safe denial semantics.

==== New Permission Variables - @rnd and @qparams

RESTHeart v9 adds two new variables to the Access Control List (ACL) system.

**@rnd(bits)** - Cryptographically Secure Random String Generation

Generates random strings using `java.security.SecureRandom`, encoded as hexadecimal.

**Use Cases:**

- Secure user registration with automatic OTP generation
- API key generation for service accounts
- Temporary access tokens for password reset workflows
- Multi-factor authentication with verification codes

**Example - User Registration with OTP:**

[source,yml]
----
permissions:
  - role: $unauthenticated
    predicate: path('/users') and method(POST)
    mongo:
      mergeRequest:
        otp: "@rnd(32)"
        verified: false
        role: "pending"
----

**@qparams['key']** - Query Parameter Access

Retrieves query parameter values from request URLs for authorization decisions.

**Example - OTP Verification:**

[source,yml]
----
permissions:
  - role: pending
    predicate: >
      path('/users/{userid}/verify') and
      method(PATCH) and
      equals(@user._id, '{userid}') and
      equals(@user.otp, @qparams['otp'])
    mongo:
      mergeRequest:
        verified: true
        role: "user"
----

**Complete Workflow:**

1. User registers → System generates OTP and stores it
2. User receives OTP (via email/SMS)
3. User calls verify endpoint with OTP as query parameter
4. System validates OTP using `@qparams['otp']`
5. Upon success, user role is escalated and account is verified

==== Add Request Attached Parameters to Account Properties in MongoRealmAuthenticator

RESTHeart v9 enhances MongoRealmAuthenticator to automatically include specified request parameters as account properties after successful authentication.

**Problem:**

Interceptors running at `BEFORE_AUTH` can attach parameters using `request.attachParam(key, value)`, but these parameters were not carried over to authenticated account properties.

**Solution:**

Add an `attached-props` configuration option:

[source,yml]
----
mongoRealmAuthenticator:
  enabled: true
  users-db: restheart
  users-collection: users
  attached-props:
    - tenantId
    - organizationId
    - host
----

**Behaviors:**

- Only listed parameters are copied (backward compatible)
- Missing parameters are silently skipped
- Parameters are transferred after successful authentication

**Use Cases:**

1. **Custom attributes** - Attach organizational metadata or user-specific data accessible throughout request lifecycle
2. **Dynamic authorization** - Use account properties in security predicates without additional database lookups

**Example - Multi-tenant Authorization:**

An interceptor at `BEFORE_AUTH` extracts tenant ID from request and attaches it:

[source,java]
----
@Override
public void handle(Request<?> request, Response<?> response) {
    var tenantId = extractTenantId(request);
    request.attachParam("tenantId", tenantId);
}
----

After authentication, the tenant ID is available in account properties and can be used in ACL predicates:

[source,yml]
----
permissions:
  - role: user
    predicate: equals(@user.tenantId, @request.tenantId)
----

=== Upgrade Guide

==== Prerequisites

- Java 25 LTS must be installed
- MongoDB 5.0 or later is recommended
- Review deprecated features list

==== Breaking Changes

1. **JWT Configuration Restructuring**
   - **JWT Now Default**: JWT authentication is now enabled by default (previously RND tokens were default)
   - **Centralized Configuration**: New `jwtConfigProvider` component consolidates JWT settings (key, algorithm, issuer, audience) into a single source of truth, eliminating duplication across `jwtAuthenticationMechanism` and `jwtTokenManager`
   - **Secure Key Generation**: JWT key defaults changed from `"secret"` to `null`, enabling automatic secure random key generation
   - **Cookie Handling Enabled**: `authCookieHandler` and `authCookieSetter` are now enabled by default
   - **Cookie TTL Unit Change**: Cookie TTL configuration unit changed from seconds (`expires-ttl`) to minutes
   - **Token Endpoint Change**: Token service URI changed from `/tokens` to `/token`
   - Action: Review and update JWT configuration if you have custom settings
   - Action: If you prefer RND tokens, explicitly disable JWT and enable RND in your configuration
   - Action: Update any references from `/tokens` to `/token` endpoint

2. **Map-Reduce Pipelines Removed**
   - Action: Migrate all map-reduce aggregations to standard aggregation pipelines before upgrading

3. **Docker Image Changes**
   - Action: Update Docker references from `softinstigate/restheart` (OpenJDK) to the GraalVM-based image
   - Note: The `latest` tag now points to the GraalVM image

4. **GraphQL App Descriptor Structure**
   - Action: Remove `descriptor.name` field from GraphQL app definition documents
   - Action: Ensure `_id` fields are strings if not using custom URIs

5. **Token Authentication Endpoints**
   - Action: Update client applications to use `/token` or `/token/cookie` endpoints
   - Action: Remove `?set-auth-cookie` and similar query parameters from API calls

6. **CORS Headers Optimization**
   - **Exposed Headers Changed**: Default `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` is now empty (previously included `Location`, `ETag`, `Auth-Token`, etc.)
   - Action: Services that set response headers like `Location`, `ETag`, or custom headers must implement the `accessControlExposeHeaders()` method to explicitly expose them
   - Action: Review browser-based applications that rely on reading response headers and ensure services expose the necessary headers
   - Note: This is a critical change for services that return `Location` headers (e.g., POST operations that create resources)

==== Configuration Updates

**JWT Configuration Provider:**

RESTHeart v9 introduces a centralized JWT configuration provider that eliminates duplication. JWT settings are now defined once and shared across all JWT-related components:

[source,yml]
----
jwtConfigProvider:
  key: null  # null enables secure random key generation
  algorithm: HS256
  issuer: restheart
  audience: restheart
----

**Default JWT Authentication:**

JWT authentication is now enabled by default with secure defaults. If you prefer RND tokens, update your configuration:

[source,yml]
----
# Disable JWT authentication and token manager
jwtAuthenticationMechanism:
  enabled: false

jwtTokenManager:
  enabled: false

# Enable RND token manager
rndTokenManager:
  enabled: true
----

**Cookie Handling:**

Cookie handlers are now enabled by default. Note the TTL unit has changed from seconds to minutes:

[source,yml]
----
authCookieHandler:
  enabled: true

authCookieSetter:
  enabled: true
  ttl: 15  # minutes (previously was expires-ttl in seconds)
----

**Token Endpoint:**

The token service endpoint has changed from `/tokens` to `/token`:

[source,yml]
----
authTokenService:
  uri: /token  # changed from /tokens
----

**Aggregation Security:**

Review and configure aggregation security settings based on your security requirements:

[source,yml]
----
mongo:
  aggregationSecurity:
    blacklistedStages:
      - $out
      - $merge
    allowJavaScriptExecution: false
----

**MongoRealmAuthenticator:**

If using attached parameters, add the `attached-props` configuration:

[source,yml]
----
mongoRealmAuthenticator:
  attached-props:
    - tenantId
    - customAttribute
----
