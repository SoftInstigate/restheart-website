## Introduction

[GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) is a new virtual machine from Oracle that supports a polyglot runtime environment and the ability to compile Java applications to native images.

RESTHeart fully supports the GraalVM:

- you can run RESTHeart using the GraalVM
- starting from v5.2, you can build RESTHeart (and your custom plugins) to a native image using GraalVMâ€™s `native-image` tool

### Benefits of running RESTHeart with the GraalVM

The GraalVM is a polyglot runtime environment, so that you can seamlessly use multiple languages to implement RESTHeart plugins.

In the v5.2 product line we will progressively leverage the GraalVM to allow you to develop plugins, such as [services](/docs/plugins/core-plugins/#services) and [interceptors](https://restheart.org/docs/plugins/core-plugins/#interceptors) by just defining JavaScript lambda functions.

### Benefits of building a native image

Build your RESTHeart application to native image provides multiple advantages, including faster startup times and lesser memory consumption.

For comparison, a RESTHeart with default plugins startup time


||JVM|native|
|-|-|-|
|startup time|~2 secs|~150ms|
|memory|1,25Gbyte|279Mbyte|
|througput|70,000 req/sec|48,000 req/sec|


{: .bs-callout.bs-callout-info}
Native image usually results in worse peak performance. Read [this great article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59488654/does-graalvm-native-image-increase-overall-application-performance-or-just-reduc) for more information.

The numbers clearly show that running RESTHeart as a native image is ideal for clustering. With instant startup time and much lesser memory consumption you can run multiple instances of RESTHeart Docker images and also better support dynamic scaling.

## Install the GraalVM

We suggest to install GraalVM with [sdkman](https://sdkman.io)

```
$ sdk install java 20.3.0.r11-grl
```

After having installed GraalVM, you can install the `native-image` tool with `gu`

```bash
$ gu install native-image
```

## Run RESTHeart with GraalVM

Check that GraalVM SDK is active:

```bash
$ java -version
openjdk version "11.0.9" 2020-10-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment GraalVM CE 20.3.0 (build 11.0.9+10-jvmci-20.3-b06)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM GraalVM CE 20.3.0 (build 11.0.9+10-jvmci-20.3-b06, mixed mode, sharing)
```

Then just run RESTHeart as usual:

```bash
$ java -jar restheart.jar etc/restheart.yml -e etc/default.properties
```

## Build RESTHeart with default plugins as native image

RESTHeart's `pom.xml` includes the `native` profile; you can then simply build it with

```bash
$ git checkout https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart.git
$ cd restheart
$ mvn clean package -Pnative
```

As a result, you'll find the executable binary file `target/restheart-native`.

## Build RESTHeart with custom plugins as native image

In order to build RESTHeart with custom plugins as native image you use maven to:

- build a uber-jar using the [Maven Shade Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/)
- define a the profile `native` that uses the [Native Image Maven Plugin](https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/NativeImageMavenPlugin/) to build the native image from the uber-jar

{: .bs-callout.bs-callout-info }
At startup time, RESTHeart dynamically loads the plugins jars found in  the `/plugins` directory. Dynamic class loading is simply not possible with GraalVM. This is why you need to package RESTHeart core and all plugins in a uber-jar.

Add the `native` profile to your `pom.xml`

Use this example [pom.xml](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/web-frameworks/blob/native/java/restheart/pom.xml) as a reference for your project.

You can now build the native image with:

```bash
$ mvn clean package -Pnative
```

### A docker image to build Linux native images

[SoftInstigate](https://softinstigate.com) maintains the Debian based, docker image [softinstigate/graalvm-maven](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/graalvm-maven-docker) with GraalVM and Maven and `native-image`.

Use it if you are running a different OS and you need to build a native image for Linux to include it in a Docker image.

```bash
$ docker pull softinstigate/graalvm-maven
```

You can build a Linux native image with:

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm \
    -v "$PWD":/opt/app  \
    -v "$HOME"/.m2:/root/.m2 \
    softinstigate/graalvm-maven \
    clean package -Pnative
```
