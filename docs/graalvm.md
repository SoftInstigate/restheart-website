## Introduction

[GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) is a new virtual machine from Oracle that supports a polyglot runtime environment and the ability to compile Java applications to native images.

RESTHeart fully supports the GraalVM:

- you can run RESTHeart using the GraalVM
- you can build RESTHeart (and your custom plugins) to a native image using GraalVMâ€™s `native-image` tool

## Why GraalVM

GraalVM provides advanced optimizing compiler that generates fast lean code which requires fewer compute resources and allows Ahead-of-Time Compilation to build
Native binaries that start up instantly and deliver peak performance with no warm up time.

### Benefits of running RESTHeart with the GraalVM

The GraalVM is faster than OpenJDK and it is also a polyglot runtime environment, so that you can seamlessly use multiple languages to implement RESTHeart plugins.

RESTHeart leverages the GraalVM to allow developing [services](/docs/plugins/core-plugins/#services) and [interceptors](https://restheart.org/docs/plugins/core-plugins/#interceptors) using JavaScript.

See [Polyglot JavaScript Services and Interceptors on GraalVM](/docs/upgrade-to-v6/#graalvm) for more details.

### Benefits of running RESTHeart as a native image

Building a RESTHeart application to native image provides multiple advantages, including faster startup time and smaller memory footprint.

{: .bs-callout.bs-callout-info}
A *RESTHeart application* is a bundle of RESTHeart core and plugins. The plugins can include the one shipped with RESTHeart (`restheart-mongodb.jar` and `restheart-security.jar`) and custom plugins that implement your application logic.

The following table compares RESTHeart (with default plugins) running on a MacBook Pro with OpenJDK, GraalVM CE and GraalVM CE native image.

{: .table .table-responsive}
||OpenJDK|GraalVM CE|GraalVM CE native|
|-|-|-|-|
|startup time|2441ms|2042ms|249ms|
|memory|487Mbyte|761Mbyte|279Mbyte|
|integration test execution time|63,503s|57,292s|52,518s|

<img class="img-fluid" src="/images/graalvm-benchmark.png">

The numbers clearly show that running RESTHeart as a native image is ideal for microservices and clustering. With instant startup time and smaller memory footprint you can run multiple instances of RESTHeart Docker images and also better support dynamic scaling.

{: .bs-callout.bs-callout-warning}
In some use cases, native image might result in slightly worse peak performance. Read [this great article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59488654/does-graalvm-native-image-increase-overall-application-performance-or-just-reduc) for more information. The fact that peak performances might be worse, is well compensated by the ability to run more RESTHeart instances in parallel due to much smaller memory footprint.

## Install the GraalVM

We suggest to install GraalVM with [sdkman](https://sdkman.io)

You need at least version 21.1 for Java 16:

```
$ sdk install java 21.1.0.r16-grl
```

After having installed GraalVM, you can install the `native-image` tool with `gu`

```bash
$ gu install native-image
```

## Run RESTHeart with GraalVM

Check that GraalVM SDK is active:

```bash
$ java -version
openjdk version "16.0.1" 2021-04-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment GraalVM CE 21.1.0 (build 16.0.1+9-jvmci-21.1-b05)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM GraalVM CE 21.1.0 (build 16.0.1+9-jvmci-21.1-b05, mixed mode, sharing)
```

Then just run RESTHeart as usual:

```bash
$ java -jar restheart.jar etc/restheart.yml -e etc/default.properties
```

## Build stock RESTHeart as native image

{: .bs-callout.bs-callout-info }
A Docker image of RESTHeart native is available tagged as `softinstigate/restheart:<version>-native`

Example:

```bash
$ docker pull softinstigate/restheart:6.0.0-native
```

The [docker-compose-native.yml](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/docker-compose-native.yml) leveraging restheart-native is available as well. It runs restheart-native and MongoDB stack.

### how to build from source

RESTHeart's `pom.xml` includes the `native` profile.

Check that GraalVM SDK is active:

```bash
$ java -version
openjdk version "16.0.1" 2021-04-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment GraalVM CE 21.1.0 (build 16.0.1+9-jvmci-21.1-b05)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM GraalVM CE 21.1.0 (build 16.0.1+9-jvmci-21.1-b05, mixed mode, sharing)
```

You can then simply build it with:

```bash
$ git checkout https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart.git
$ cd restheart
$ mvn clean package -Pnative
```

As a result, you'll find the executable binary file `target/restheart-native`.

## Build RESTHeart with custom plugins as native image

In order to build RESTHeart with custom plugins as native image you use maven to:

- build a uber-jar using the [Maven Shade Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/)
- define a the profile `native` that uses the [Native Image Maven Plugin](https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/NativeImageMavenPlugin/) to build the native image from the uber-jar

{: .bs-callout.bs-callout-info }
At startup time, RESTHeart dynamically loads the plugins jars found in  the `/plugins` directory. Dynamic class loading is simply not possible with GraalVM. This is why you need to package RESTHeart core and all plugins in a uber-jar and provide reflection configuration for the `native-image`.

### uber-jar

Define the Maven `native` profile following this example [pom.xml](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/web-frameworks/blob/native/java/restheart/pom.xml).


### Reflection configuration

In order for the custom plugin to work, you need to define the native image `reflect-config.json` file in the directory `src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/<package-name>/<artifact-id>`

An example is the [reflect-config.json](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/test-plugins/src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/org.restheart/restheart-test-plugins/reflect-config.json) of the RESTHeart's own `test-plugins` module.

For instance, the following entry is present for the Interceptor [https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/test-plugins/src/main/java/org/restheart/test/plugins/interceptors/SnooperHook.java](SnooperHook)

```json
{
    "name": "org.restheart.test.plugins.interceptors.SnooperHook",
    "methods": [
        { "name": "<init>", "parameterTypes": [] },
        { "name": "init", "parameterTypes": ["java.util.Map"] }
    ]
}
```

### build

You can now build the native image with:

```bash
$ mvn clean package -Pnative
```

For further information, good starting points are:

- [Native Image Compatibility and Optimization Guide](https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/Limitations/) on GraalVM website
- [GRAALVM.md](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/GRAALVM.md) on RESTHeart github repository

## A docker image to build Linux native images

[SoftInstigate](https://softinstigate.com) maintains the Debian based, docker image [softinstigate/graalvm-maven](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/graalvm-maven-docker) with GraalVM and Maven and `native-image`.

Use it if you are running a different OS and you need to build a native image for Linux to include it in a Docker image.

```bash
$ docker pull softinstigate/graalvm-maven
```

You can build a Linux native image with:

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm \
    -v "$PWD":/opt/app  \
    -v "$HOME"/.m2:/root/.m2 \
    softinstigate/graalvm-maven \
    clean package -Pnative
```
