== Introduction

Services and Interceptors can be developed in JavaScript and TypeScript when running RESTHeart with GraalVM or using `restheart-native`

Here is an example

[source,javascript]
----
export const options = {
    name: "helloWorldService",
    description: "just another Hello World",
    uri: "/hello"
}

export function handle(request, response) {
    response.setContent(`{ "msg": `Hello ${rc.name || 'World'}` } `);
    response.setContentTypeAsJson();
}
----

TIP:  See link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/tree/master/polyglot/src/test/resources[example JS plugins]

Just copy the `test-js-plugins` directory into the `plugins` directory to have the JS plugins automatically deployed.

JS plugins can be added or updated without requiring to restart the server, ie v6 supports JS plugins hot deployment.
