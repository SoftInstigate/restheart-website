:page-liquid:

== Introduction

_Services_ and _Interceptors_ can be developed in _JavaScript_ and _TypeScript_ when running RESTHeart with the GraalVM or using RESTHeart native.

TIP: See link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/tree/master/polyglot/src/test/resources[example JS plugins]

NOTE: The default RESTHeart native binaries, can only be extended with JavaScript plugins. With Java plugins, you need to build RESTHeart and the plugins with the `native-image` tool. See link:/docs/graalvm/#build-restheart-with-custom-plugins-as-native-image[Build RESTHeart with custom plugins as native-image]

== RESTHeart Concurrency Model

RESTHeart is a multi-threaded application and it handles each request in a dedicated thread. This makes all code running in a request thread safe, and this also applies to JavaScript services and interceptors.

This is different than usual JavaScript concurrency model, where all code is usually executed in a single thread and requires asynchronous programming, with callbacks, promises, observable, etc.

In RESTHeart, you can write simple JavaScript code that also includes blocking calls, without incurring in performance problems.

== Service

The JavaScript code that defines a `Service` must export the object `options` and the function `handle(req, res)`.

The resulting service will be a special instance of link:https://javadoc.io/doc/org.restheart/restheart-commons/latest/org/restheart/plugins/StringService.html[StringService], that delegates the handling logic to the JavaScript code. For this reason, the request and response bodies are treated as strings.

[source,javascript]
----
export const options = {
    name: "helloWorldService",
    description: "just another Hello World",
    uri: "/hello"
}

export function handle(req, res) {
    res.setContent(`{ "msg": `Hello ${rc.name || 'World'}` } `);
    res.setContentTypeAsJson();
}
----

=== The object `options`

The `options` object must contain the following properties:

[.table]
|===
|param |description |mandatory |default value

|`name`
|the name of the service
|yes
|*none*

|`description`
|description of the service
|yes
|*none*

|`uri`
|the uri of the service
|yes
|*none*

|`secured`
|`true` to require successful authentication and authorization to be invoked;
|no
|`false`

|`matchPolicy`
| `PREFIX` to match request paths starting with `/<uri>`,`EXACT` to only match the request path  `/<uri>` | no  | `PREFIX`

|`modulesReplacements`
| experimental support for module replacements. See *Node.js core modules mockups* on link:https://www.graalvm.org/22.0/reference-manual/js/Modules/[Using JavaScript Modules and Packages in GraalVM JavaScript] for modules. Example `buffer:my-buffer-implementation` | no | `""` (empty) |

|===

=== The function `handle(req, res)`

The `handle` functions accepts two parameters: the request and the response. These are Java objects of link:https://javadoc.io/doc/org.restheart/restheart-commons/latest/org/restheart/exchange/StringRequest.html[StringRequest] and link:https://javadoc.io/doc/org.restheart/restheart-commons/latest/org/restheart/exchange/StringResponse.html[StringResponse] respectively.

== Interceptor

The JavaScript code that defines an `Interceptor` export the object `options` and the functions `handle(req, res)` and `resolve(req)`.

[source,javascript]
----
export const options = {
    name: "helloWorldInterceptor",
    description: "modifies the response of helloWorldService",
    interceptPoint: "RESPONSE"
}

export function handle(request, response) {
    const rc = JSON.parse(response.getContent() || '{}');

    let modifiedBody = {
        msg: rc.msg + ' from Italy with Love';
    }

    response.setContent(JSON.stringify(modifiedBody));
    response.setContentTypeAsJson();
}

export function resolve(request) {
    return request.isHandledBy("helloWorldService");
}
----

=== The object `options`

The `options` object must contain the following properties:

[.table]
|===
|param |description |mandatory |default value

|`name`
|the name of the interceptor
|yes
|*none*

|`description`
|description of the interceptor
|yes
|*none*

|`interceptPoint`
| the intercept point: `REQUEST_BEFORE_AUTH`, `REQUEST_AFTER_AUTH`, `RESPONSE`, `RESPONSE_ASYNC` | no  | REQUEST_AFTER_AUTH

|`pluginClass`
| the class of the interceptor that must match the service to intercept (e.g. `MongoInterceptor` can intercept a request handled by the `MongoService`), `StringInterceptor`, `BsonInterceptor`, `ByteArrayProxyInterceptor`, `CsvInterceptor`, `JsonInterceptor`, `MongoInterceptor`
|no
|`StringInterceptor`


|`modulesReplacements`
| experimental support for module replacements. See *Node.js core modules mockups* on link:https://www.graalvm.org/22.0/reference-manual/js/Modules/[Using JavaScript Modules and Packages in GraalVM JavaScript] for modules. Example `buffer:my-buffer-implementation` | no | `""` (empty) |

|===

=== The function `resolve(req)`

The function `resolve()` accepts one parameter `req`, a Java object of the concrete subclass of link:https://javadoc.io/doc/org.restheart/restheart-commons/latest/org/restheart/exchange/Request.html[Request] defined by the parameter `pluginClass`, e.g. with  `pluginClass: "StringInterceptor"`, the request class is link:https://javadoc.io/doc/org.restheart/restheart-commons/latest/org/restheart/exchange/StringRequest.html[StringRequest].

An interceptor of a given class, can intercept requests handled by all services with matching types, e.g. `MongoInterceptor` can intercept requests handled by the `MongoService`.

When `resolve()` returns `true` the interceptor will be actually invoked, i.e. this function allows to select the requests to intercept.

=== The function `handle(req, res)`

The `handle()` functions accepts two parameters: the request and the response.
These a Java objects of the concrete subclasses of link:https://javadoc.io/doc/org.restheart/restheart-commons/latest/org/restheart/exchange/Request.html[Request] and link:https://javadoc.io/doc/org.restheart/restheart-commons/latest/org/restheart/exchange/Response.html[Response] respectively.  For the default `pluginClass: "StringInterceptor"`, these are link:https://javadoc.io/doc/org.restheart/restheart-commons/latest/org/restheart/exchange/StringRequest.html[StringRequest] and link:https://javadoc.io/doc/org.restheart/restheart-commons/latest/org/restheart/exchange/StringResponse.html[StringResponse] respectively.

== Packaging

The plugins js files must be placed in a folder with a `package.json` file.

NOTE: a single plugin folder can contain multiple Services and Interceptors.

The `package.json` muse declare the services in the `rh:services` array and interceptors in the `rh:interceptors` array.

[source,json]
----
{
  "name": "restheart-js-foo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "test js plugins for RESTHeart",
  "rh:services": [ "foo.js" ],
  "rh:interceptors": [ "foo-interceptor.js" ]
}
----

== Modules

The plugins can use npm `modules` via `require` statements. See link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/polyglot/src/test/resources/test-js-plugins/require-module-service.js[requre-module-service.js] for an example.

IMPORTANT: The imported modules cannot use  functionalities that are available in Node.jsâ€™ built-in modules (e.g., 'fs' and 'buffer', etc.).

For instance, you cannot use the module `http`, and there is no pure JS implementation available. In this case, you can rely on <<interop,Java/Javascript interoperability>>  and use the  standard Java libraries and all the libraries that are available in RESTHeart.

See link:https://www.graalvm.org/22.0/reference-manual/js/Modules/[GraalVM Modules] for more details.

== Deploy

To the JavaScript plugin, just copy the folder containing the scripts and the file `package.json` into the `plugins` directory of RESTHeart.

NOTE: JS plugins can be added or updated without requiring to restart the server, ie RESTHeart supports JS plugins hot deployment.

If you modify the code, you can force RESTHeart to update it by touching the plugin folder.

[source,bash]
$ touch plugins/my-plugin

== Configuration parameters

It is possible to defined configuration parameters for the plugins by just defining them in the yml configuration file, under the `plugins-args` section.

[source,yml]
----
plugins-args:
    foo: # <-- name of the plugin
        arg: value
----

The arguments are available in the `pluginArgs` object.

[source,javascript]
----
const arg = pluginArgs.arg
----

== Java/JavaScript interoperability [[interop]]

GraalVM allows to execute JavaScript code from RESTHeart and allows interoperability with Java code.

This means that all the Java classes shipped with RESTHeart can be used in JavaScript code.

For example, see the link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/polyglot/src/test/resources/test-js-plugins/http-client.js[http-client.js] plugins, which uses `java.net.http.HttpClient` to execute an HTTP request.

== MongoDB driver

The MongoDb Java driver, configured by RESTHeart configuration file and already connected to MongoDB, is available in the JavaScript code as `mclient`.

See link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/polyglot/src/test/resources/test-js-plugins/mclient-service.js[mclient-service.js] for an example of how to use it.

== Logging

The RESTHeart Java logger can be used from JavaScript code.

[source,javascript]
----
LOGGER.debug("pluginArgs {}", pluginArgs);
----

Pay attention to logging null values. With:

[source,javascript]
----
var foo = null;
LOGGER.debug("this is null {}", foo);
----

An error will be raised.

[source,bash]
----
org.graalvm.polyglot.PolyglotException: TypeError: invokeMember (debug) on ch.qos.logback.classic.Logger@697713cb failed due to: Multiple applicable overloads found for method name debug...
----

To avoid it, use the following code:

[source,javascript]
----
var foo = null;
LOGGER.debug("this is null {}", foo ? foo : "null");
----
