title: RESTHeart User Signup Tutorial
layout: docs-adoc
menu: framework
---

== Overview

This tutorial demonstrates an implementation of a user signup process, including user document creation, verification code generation, and email verification and provides guidance on using the development framework to implement microservices.

NOTE: Source code available https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/tree/master/examples/user-signup[here].

== Process Flow

* *User Creation*: An unauthenticated client sends a POST request to `/users` to create a new user document.
* *Verification Code*: The `verificationCodeGenerator` interceptor adds a verification code to the user document upon creation.
* *User Roles*: The newly created user is assigned `roles: ["UNVERIFIED"]`. This is set by the `mergeRequest` statement in the permission, allowing unauthenticated clients to create user documents. The role `UNVERIFIED` is defined in the ACL with no permissions.
* *Email Verification*: The `emailVerificationSender` async response interceptor sends a verification email. This email contains a link to the `userVerifier` service, passing the verification code as a query parameter.
* *User Verification*: The `userVerifier` service plays a crucial role in the verification process. Upon receiving the verification code, it authenticates the code's validity. Once verified, the service updates the user's role to `["USER"]`. This updated role is significant as it is predefined in the Access Control List (ACL) with specific permissions. Notably, it grants the verified user the ability to access the collection `/coll`. This access is essential as it enables the verified user to interact with the core data of the dummy application, marking a successful transition from an unverified to a fully authenticated and functional user within the system.

== Deployment Steps

First clone the restheart repository and cd into the `user-signup` directory.

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:SoftInstigate/restheart.git
$ cd restheart/examples/user-signup
$ ../mvnw clean package
$ cp target/user-signup.jar target/lib/* $RH_HOME/plugins
----

=== Simplified Deployment with the `rh.sh` Script

NOTE: This method works if you are on a system able to execute bash scripts.

Ease your deployment process with the `rh.sh` script, a convenient tool for automating various tasks in setting up RESTHeart. You can retrieve this script from the link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart-plugin-skeleton[RESTHeart Plugin Skeleton repository].

**Downloading the Script**

Begin by creating a `bin` directory and downloading the `rh.sh` script into it:

[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir bin && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SoftInstigate/restheart-plugin-skeleton/master/bin/rh.sh --output bin/rh.sh
----

Then link the Maven wrapper `mvnw` that is available on the parent directory because `rh.sh` requires it.

[source,bash]
----
$ ln -s ../mvnw mvnw
----

**Utilizing `rh.sh` for Effortless Deployment**

The `rh.sh` script is ingeniously designed to streamline the entire deployment process. It's capable of installing RESTHeart, building your code, deploying it, and initiating the RESTHeart server - all through a single command:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./bin/rh.sh -o "-o conf.yml"
----

**Important Configuration Step**: Before executing this script, ensure you have customized the `conf.yml` file with your SMTP server details. This configuration is crucial for the script to facilitate the sending of verification emails.

For detailed instructions on configuring your SMTP server in `conf.yml`, refer to the upcoming section titled **Configuration**.

=== Alternate method

1. Download and install RESTHeart. Check the link:/docs/setup[Setup] section.
2. Clone the restheart repo and navigate to the `user-signup` directory.
3. Build the plugin. This step uses the `maven-dependency-plugin` to copy the jar of the external dependency to `/target/lib`.
4. Copy the plugin JARs (`user-signup/target/user-signup.jar` and `user-signup/target/lib/*`) to the `$RH_HOME/plugins` directory.

== Configuration

Configure the `emailVerificationSender` interceptor with your SMTP server details for sending verification emails. Add the following in `conf.yml`:

[source,yml]
----
/emailVerificationSender:
  verifier-srv-url: http://127.0.0.1:8080/verify
  from: <your-email-address>
  from-name: <your-name>
  host: smtp.gmail.com
  port: 465
  smtp-username: <your-gmail-address>
  smtp-password: <your-gmail-password>
----

IMPORTANT: For Gmail, create a third-party password as described link:https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en[here].

== Run restheart with the configuration

NOTE: this command uses the link:/docs/configuration#modify-the-configuration-with-an-override-file[configuration override file]

[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar restheart.jar -o conf.yml
----

== Schema Validation

link:https://restheart.org/docs/json-schema-validation/[JSON Schema Validation] is used to ensure the user document adheres to a defined schema.

1. *Create Schema Store*:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ http -a admin:secret PUT :8080/_schemas
----

2. *Define JSON Schema for User*:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ echo '{"_id":"user","$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#","type":"object","properties":{"_id":{"type":"string","pattern":"^\\\w+@[a-zA-Z_]+?.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}$"},"password":{"type":"string"},"roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"code":{"type":"string"}},"required":["_id","password"],"additionalProperties":false}' | http -a admin:secret POST :8080/_schemas
----

3. *Apply Schema to Users*:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ echo '{"jsonSchema":{"schemaId":"user"}}' | http -a admin:secret PUT :8080/users
----

== Access Control List (ACL)

1. *Allow Unauthenticated User Creation*: Add permission to `/acl` for unauthenticated clients to create user documents.
+
NOTE: The permission sets `roles: ["UNVERIFIED"]` using the `mergeRequest` statement.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ echo '{"_id":"allowToRegister","predicate":"path[/users] and method[POST]", "roles":["$unauthenticated"], "mongo": {"mergeRequest":{"roles":["UNVERIFIED"]}}, "priority":1}' | http -a admin:secret POST :8080/acl
----

2. *Assign Permissions to `USER` Role*:
+
NOTE: The permission restricts user access to own documents using `mergeRequest`, `readFilter` and  `writeFilter` statements.

+
[source,bash]
----
$ echo '{"_id":"allowUsersToAccessColl","predicate":"path[/coll] and (method[POST] or method[GET])","roles":["USER"], "mongo": { "mergeRequest":{"author": "@user._id"},"readFilter":{"author": "@user._id"},"writeFilter":{"author": "@user._id"} }, "priority":1}' | http -a admin:secret POST :8080/acl
----

== User Creation and Verification
1. *Create User*: Unauthenticated request to create a user document.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ http POST :8080/users _id=<your-email-address> password=<your-password>
----
2. *Verify Email Address*: Click the link in the verification email. This changes the user's role to `USER`.
3. *Check User Roles*: Use the `/roles` service to verify user credentials and roles.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ http -a <your-email-address>:<your-password> :8080/roles/<your-email-address>
----

== Testing Permissions

1. *Access Collection as `UNVERIFIED` User*: Expect `403 Forbidden`.
+
[source,bash]
----
http GET :8080/coll -a <your-email-address>:<your-password>
----
2. *Access Collection as `USER`*: Post-verification, expect successful access.
+
[source,bash]
----
http GET :8080/coll -a <your-email-address>:<your-password>
----
