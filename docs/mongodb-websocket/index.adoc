This section describes the WebSocket API that allows publishing data events to WebSocket clients.

> The WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.

Ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API

> MongoDB's Change streams allow applications to access real-time data changes without the complexity and risk of tailing the oplog. Applications can use change streams to subscribe to all data changes on a single collection, a database, or an entire deployment, and immediately react to them. Because change streams use the aggregation framework, applications can also filter for specific changes or transform the notifications at will.

=== RESTHeart Change Stream

__RESTHeart embeds a WebSocket server implementation__ that allows to expose MongoDB's Change Streams to Web browsers and any kind of HTTP/WebSocket client.

With RESTHeart is possible to __create Web or Mobile apps that can be asynchronously notified in real time of data changes__. Because change streams use the link:https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/aggregation/[aggregation framework], applications can also filter for specific changes.

For example, if the stream `all` is defined on the collection `messages`, clients can connect via WebSocket to `ws://mydomain.com/messages/_streams/all` and receive real time notification of data changes occurring in the collection.

Exposing a WebSocket Server, clients may be promptly notified about these changes only if necessary, avoiding network expensive common practices like polling.

    <hr class="my-2">
    <p>Handle hundreds of thousands of concurrent clients.</p>
    <p>Check the <a class="alert-link" href="/docs/performances">performance tests</a>!</p>
</div>

NOTE:  Change streams require at least MongoDB configured as a link:https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/[Replica Set]

NOTE: When the `stream` collection metadata is modified or the collection or the db is deleted, all related WebSocket connections are closed and the change streams are consequently updated.
