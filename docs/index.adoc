> *RESTHeart is a modern, JVM/GraalVM based, platform for building cloud-native HTTP microservices*

NOTE: An _HTTP microservice_ is a server-side, lightweight component that exposes an HTTP API. Clients interact with it only through HTTP requests, usually - but not exclusively - using JSON payloads, decoupling the client from the underlying technology and completely separating the presentation from the business logic.

RESTHeart is designed from ground for _speed_ and _simplicity_ and crafted from few, best of breed libraries.

The philosophy of RESTHeart is to provide developers with a pleasant framework on one side
and the common _features_ required by any application, on the other.

This makes RESTHeart a *low code platform*, since it comes with ready-to-use, yet extensible APIs.

== What makes RESTHeart different from other frameworks?

*RESTHeart* is indeed a framework for building HTTP microservices comparable to others, like _Undertow_ (that is actually internally used by RESTHeart), _Vert.x_, _Quarkus_, _Spring Boot_, _Node.js_, etc.

However RESTHeart does not only comprises a framework, but also a set of application level features that allow developers to build their applications without the need to reinvent the wheel.

`restheart-core` is the foundation of the platform, the runtime process responsible for handling the core services, parsing the configuration, registering the plugins, enforce the security policy, route requests to the correct `Services`, executing `Interceptors` and `Initializers`.

If you look at the restheart installation directory structure, you will notice a directory called `plugins`:

[source,bash]
----
plugins
├── restheart-graphql.jar
├── restheart-mongodb.jar
├── restheart-polyglot.jar
└── restheart-security.jar
----

Those plugins implement application level functionalities that help building applications.

For instance, the plugin `restheart-mongodb` implements the REST API for MongoDB and `restheart-security.jar` implements the ready-to-use Authentication and Authorization features.

A developer can easily deploy a custom plugin, by just adding it into the `plugins` directory. The plugin is just a JAR file, in case of Java or Kotlin and a directory with its `package.json` file in case of JavaScript.

== Built for developers

RESTHeart is built for developers by developers and evolved by implementing dozens of real world projects and following one golden rule: _if it is complex, it is wrong_.

- Only three, simple yet powerful building blocks: `Services`, `Intreceptors` and `Initializers`.
- Starts in 100~ msecs, so code-deploy-test cycles are smooth and fast.
- Each request is handled in a dedicated thread, so all code is _thread-safe_, _simple_ to write and maintain and _scales well_.
- Custom code can consume properties from the `yml` configuration file.
- The framework is polyglot and supports *Java*, *Kotlin*, *JavaScript* and *Typescript*.
- Well documented with many examples and tutorials available. Check link:https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/tree/master/examples[plugin examples].

Here you have the _Hello World_ example in *Java*:

[source,java]
----
@RegisterPlugin(name = "greetings", description = "just another Hello World")
public class GreeterService implements JsonService {
    @Override
    public void handle(JsonRequest request, JsonResponse response) {
        response.setContent(object().put("message", "Hello World!"));
    }
}
----

And the same in *Javascript*

[source,javascript]
----
export const options = { name: "greetings", description: "just another Hello World" }

export function handle(request, response) {
    response.setContent(JSON.stringify({ msg: 'Hello World' }));
    response.setContentTypeAsJson();
}
----

NOTE: Javascript is executed in a thread safe, multi-threading concurrency environment. So you don't need to deal with async/await, promises, observable or any other fancy stuff. *Just clean and simple code*.

== Features

RESTHeart provides developers with the features required by most applications: authentication/authorization and data management:

- Declarative Authentication and Authorization.
- Instant REST, GraphQL and WebSocket API for MongoDB.
- SDK to easily develop custom features.

NOTE: Most applications just require this. Then you just run a stock RESTHeart. Really, no code!

TIP: Check the link:/docs/try[demo Web Chat application]. It requires *zero* lines of backend code.

== The perfect MongoDB’s companion

RESTHeart is the best API for MongoDB (and AWS DocumentDB and Azure CosmosDB)

- It exposes full database’s capabilities via REST, GraphQL and WebSocket APIs.
- Developers don’t need to write a single line of backend code to handle data and wit Mobile Apps, Web Apps or Integration Middleware.
- The Instant Data API cuts development complexity and costs up to 90%.

== Extreme Performances

*Hundreds of thousands TPS*

RESTHeart parallel architecture provides superior performances.
link:/docs/performances[Read More]

*Horizontal scaling*

RESTHeart is fully stateless and allows clustering, to reach demanding
requirements (only supported with the Enterprise License).
link:/docs/clustering[Read More]

*Even faster on GraalVM*

RESTHeart for GraalVM (supported with the Enterprise License) provides a
native solution with instant startup time and smaller memory footprint.
This is perfect when deploying to Kubernetes clusters,
where regular Java applications usually consume too many resources.

== Deploy at rest

RESTHeart is tailored for the JVM, GraalVM, Docker or Kubernetes,
designed to radically simplify microservices development and deployment.

- Ready-to-run Runtime.
- Available as a standalone JAR file, native binary or Docker image.
- Deploy it on Cloud and On-Premises.

== Dual licensed

RESTHeart is dual-licensed under the AGPL and a Business Friendly
Enterprise License

- Enjoy the free AGPL distribution without feature restrictions.
- Rely on the Enterprise License for production-grade support and to use RESTHeart in closed source products or services.
