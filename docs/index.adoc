*RESTHeart is a modern, JVM/GraalVM based, platform for building cloud-native microservice applications.*

It is designed from ground for _speed_ and _simplicity_ and crafted from few, best of breed libraries.

The philosophy of RESTHeart is to provide developers with
the _API_ required by any application on one side,
and a pleasant framework for _extending_ it, on the other.

== Pleasant for developers

RESTHeart is built for developers by developers and evolved by implementing dozens of real world projects and following one golden rule: _if it is complex, it is wrong_.

- Only three, simple yet powerful building blocks: `Services`, `Intreceptors` and `Initializers`.
- Custom code can consume properties from the `yml` configuration file.
- Starts in 100~ msecs, so code-deploy-test cycles are smooth and fast.
- Each request is handled in a dedicated thread, so all code is _thread-safe_, _simple_ to write and maintain and _scales well_.
- The framework is polyglot and supports *Java*, *Kotlin*, *JavaScript* and *Typescript*.
- Well documented with many examples and tutorials available. Check link:http://github.com/softInstigate/restheart-examples[this repo].

Here you have the _Hello World_ example in *Java*:

[source,java]
----
@RegisterPlugin(name = "greetings", description = "just another Hello World")
public class GreeterService implements JsonService {
    @Override
    public void handle(JsonRequest request, JsonResponse response) {
        var content = new JsonObject();

        content.addProperty("message", "Hello World!");
        response.setContent(content);
    }
}
----

And the same in *Javascript*

[source,javascript]
----
export const options = { name: "greetings", description: "just another Hello World" }

export function handle(request, response) {
    response.setContent(JSON.stringify({ msg: 'Hello World' }));
    response.setContentTypeAsJson();
}
----

NOTE: Javascript is executed in a thread safe, multi-threading concurrency environment. So you don't need to deal with async/await, promises, observable or any other fancy stuff. *Just clean and simple code*.

== Packed with features

RESTHeart provides developers with the the features required by any application: authentication/authorization and data management.

NOTE: Most applications just require this. Then you just run a stock RESTHeart. Really, no code!

- Declarative Authentication and Authorization.
- Instant REST, GraphQL and WebSocket API for MongoDB.
- `Interceptors` can easily customize out-of-the-box features.

TIP: Check the link:/docs/try[demo Web Chat application]. It requires *zero* lines of backend code.

== The perfect MongoDB’s companion

RESTHeart is the best API for MongoDB (and AWS DocumentDB and Azure CosmosDB)

- It exposes full database’s capabilities via REST, GraphQL and WebSocket APIs.
- Developers don’t need to write a single line of backend code to handle data and wit Mobile Apps, Web Apps or Integration Middleware.
- The Instant Data API cuts development complexity and costs up to 90%.

== Extreme Performances

*Hundreds of thousands TPS*

RESTHeart parallel architecture provides superior performances.
link:/docs/performances[Read More]

*Horizontal scaling*

RESTHeart is fully stateless and allows clustering, to reach demanding
requirements (only supported with the Enterprise License).
link:/docs/clustering[Read More]

*Even faster on GraalVM*

RESTHeart for GraalVM (supported with the Enterprise License) provides a
native solution with instant startup time and smaller memory footprint.
This is perfect when deploying to Kubernetes clusters,
where regular Java applications usually consume too many resources.

== Deploy at rest

RESTHeart is tailored for the JVM, GraalVM, Docker or Kubernetes,
designed to radically simplify microservices development and deployment.

- Ready-to-run Runtime.
- Available as a standalone JAR file, native binary or Docker image.
- Deploy it on Cloud and On-Premises.

== Dual licensed

RESTHeart is dual-licensed under the AGPL and a Business Friendly
Enterprise License

- Enjoy the free AGPL distribution without feature restrictions.
- Rely on the Enterprise License for production-grade support and to use RESTHeart in closed source products or services.
