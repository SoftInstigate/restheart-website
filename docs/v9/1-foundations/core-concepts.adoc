== Core Concepts

This page explains RESTHeart's architecture and the key concepts you need to understand.

**Prerequisites:** Read link:/docs/v9/1-foundations/introduction[Introduction to RESTHeart] first.

== The RESTHeart Runtime

At its core, RESTHeart is a runtime process (`restheart-core`) that:

1. **Loads Configuration** - Reads settings from configuration files or environment variables
2. **Registers Plugins** - Discovers and initializes plugins from the `plugins/` directory
3. **Routes Requests** - Maps incoming HTTP requests to the correct service
4. **Enforces Security** - Applies authentication and authorization rules
5. **Executes Interceptors** - Runs interceptors at various stages of request processing
6. **Manages Lifecycle** - Handles startup, shutdown, and plugin initialization

When you start RESTHeart with `java -jar restheart.jar`, this runtime process begins and loads everything needed to handle HTTP requests.

== Standard Plugins

RESTHeart ships with standard plugins in the `plugins/` directory:

[source,bash]
----
plugins/
├── restheart-graphql.jar           # GraphQL API for MongoDB
├── restheart-mongoclient-provider.jar  # MongoDB connection provider
├── restheart-mongodb.jar            # REST API for MongoDB
├── restheart-polyglot.jar           # JavaScript/TypeScript support
└── restheart-security.jar           # Authentication & Authorization
----

These plugins provide the ready-to-use MongoDB APIs you can use without writing code.

**Key point:** These are just plugins! RESTHeart treats them the same as custom plugins you develop.

== The Four Plugin Types

RESTHeart has four types of plugins, each serving a specific purpose:

=== 1. Services

**Purpose:** Handle HTTP requests at specific URIs.

**Use cases:**
- REST APIs
- GraphQL endpoints
- Custom business logic endpoints
- File uploads/downloads
- WebSocket connections

**Example:** The MongoDB REST API is implemented as a Service that handles requests to `/{db}/{collection}`.

**Learn more:** link:/docs/v9/6-framework/services[Developing Services]

=== 2. Interceptors

**Purpose:** Monitor and modify requests/responses as they flow through RESTHeart.

**Use cases:**
- Logging requests
- Adding custom headers
- Transforming responses
- Validating request data
- Enforcing business rules

**Intercept points:**
- `REQUEST_BEFORE_AUTH` - Before authentication
- `REQUEST_AFTER_AUTH` - After authentication, before the service
- `RESPONSE` - After the service, before sending to client
- `RESPONSE_ASYNC` - Asynchronously after sending response

**Example:** A logging interceptor that records every API call.

**Learn more:** link:/docs/v9/6-framework/interceptors[Developing Interceptors]

=== 3. Providers

**Purpose:** Supply objects to other plugins via dependency injection.

**Use cases:**
- Database connections
- Configuration objects
- External API clients
- Shared utilities

**Example:** The `mongoclient-provider` makes the MongoDB client available to other plugins with `@Inject("mclient")`.

**Learn more:** link:/docs/v9/6-framework/providers[Providers and Dependency Injection]

=== 4. Initializers

**Purpose:** Execute initialization logic at startup.

**Use cases:**
- Database schema setup
- Loading reference data
- Starting background tasks
- Warming up caches

**Init points:**
- `BEFORE_STARTUP` - Before RESTHeart starts accepting requests
- `AFTER_STARTUP` - After RESTHeart is ready

**Example:** An initializer that creates default database indexes on startup.

**Learn more:** link:/docs/v9/6-framework/initializers[Initializers]

== Request Lifecycle

Understanding how RESTHeart processes requests is key to working with the framework.

=== The Flow

[source,text]
----
1. HTTP Request arrives
   ↓
2. REQUEST_BEFORE_AUTH Interceptors run
   ↓
3. Authentication (identify the user)
   ↓
4. Authorization (check permissions)
   ↓
5. REQUEST_AFTER_AUTH Interceptors run
   ↓
6. Service handles the request
   ↓
7. RESPONSE Interceptors run
   ↓
8. HTTP Response sent to client
   ↓
9. RESPONSE_ASYNC Interceptors run (optional)
----

=== Key Points

**Virtual Threads:** Each request runs in its own virtual thread. This means:
- Your code is thread-safe by default
- No need for async/await or callbacks
- Simple, straightforward code
- Excellent scalability

**Interceptor Order:** Multiple interceptors at the same point run by priority (lower number = higher priority).

**Service Matching:** RESTHeart routes requests to services based on URI patterns configured with `@RegisterPlugin`.

== Plugin Discovery

RESTHeart automatically discovers plugins at startup:

=== Java/Kotlin Plugins

1. RESTHeart scans JAR files in `plugins/` directory
2. Looks for classes annotated with `@RegisterPlugin`
3. Instantiates and registers the plugins

=== JavaScript Plugins

1. RESTHeart scans directories in `plugins/` for `package.json`
2. Loads JavaScript files as plugins
3. Executes via the polyglot plugin

**Deployment:** Just drop a JAR file or directory in `plugins/` and restart RESTHeart!

== Configuration

=== Plugin Configuration

Each plugin can have configuration in `restheart.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
ping:
  enabled: true
  secure: false
  uri: /ping
  msg: 'Hello from RESTHeart!'
----

**Special options:**
- `enabled` - Enable/disable the plugin
- `uri` - Override default URI (Services only)
- `secure` - Require authentication (Services only)

Plugins access their configuration with:

[source,java]
----
@Inject("conf")
Map<String, Object> conf;
----

=== RESTHeart Configuration

Main configuration file: `restheart.yml`

**Key sections:**
- `http-listener` - Port, host, TLS settings
- `mclient` - MongoDB connection string
- `mongo` - MongoDB service configuration
- Plugin-specific sections

**Override methods:**
1. Configuration file: `java -jar restheart.jar restheart.yml`
2. Environment variable: `RHO='/http-listener/port->9090'`
3. Override file: `java -jar restheart.jar -o overrides.yml`

**Learn more:** link:/docs/v9/5-deployment/configuration[Configuration Guide]

== Dependency Injection

RESTHeart provides dependency injection through the `@Inject` annotation.

=== Built-in Providers

[source,java]
----
@Inject("conf")
Map<String, Object> conf;  // Plugin's configuration

@Inject("rh-config")
Configuration rhConfig;  // RESTHeart's global configuration

@Inject("mclient")
MongoClient mclient;  // MongoDB client

@Inject("registry")
PluginsRegistry registry;  // Access other plugins

@Inject("acl-registry")
ACLRegistry aclRegistry;  // Programmatic ACL management
----

=== Custom Providers

You can create your own providers to supply custom objects:

[source,java]
----
@RegisterPlugin(name = "myProvider", description = "Custom provider")
public class MyProvider implements Provider<MyService> {
    @Override
    public MyService get(PluginRecord<?> caller) {
        return new MyService();
    }
}
----

Then inject it:

[source,java]
----
@Inject("myProvider")
MyService myService;
----

== Security Architecture

RESTHeart's security has three layers:

=== 1. Authentication Mechanisms

Extract credentials from requests (Basic Auth, JWT, tokens, etc.)

=== 2. Authenticators

Verify credentials and build the user account (check username/password, validate JWT, etc.)

=== 3. Authorizers

Check if the authenticated user has permission to perform the request (ACLs, role-based, etc.)

**Security plugins** let you customize any of these layers.

- link:/docs/v9/4-security/overview[Security Overview]
- link:/docs/v9/7-security-plugins/overview[Developing Security Plugins]

== Virtual Threads

RESTHeart uses Java 21's virtual threads for superior performance:

**Benefits:**
- **Lightweight** - Millions of virtual threads vs thousands of platform threads
- **Simple code** - No async/await complexity
- **Better performance** - Efficient resource utilization
- **Scalability** - Handle massive concurrency

**For developers:** Write synchronous code that looks simple but scales massively.

[source,java]
----
// This looks synchronous but doesn't block platform threads
var data = mongoClient.find("db", "collection");  
response.setContent(data);
----

== Polyglot Support

RESTHeart supports multiple languages for plugin development:

=== Java

The native language, best performance:

[source,java]
----
@RegisterPlugin(name = "myService")
public class MyService implements JsonService {
    public void handle(JsonRequest req, JsonResponse res) {
        res.setContent(object().put("message", "Hello"));
    }
}
----

=== Kotlin

Concise JVM language with full interop:

[source,kotlin]
----
@RegisterPlugin(name = "myService")
class MyService : JsonService {
    override fun handle(req: JsonRequest, res: JsonResponse) {
        res.setContent(Json.obj().put("message", "Hello"))
    }
}
----

=== JavaScript/TypeScript

Familiar syntax for web developers:

[source,javascript]
----
export const options = { name: "myService" }

export function handle(request, response) {
    response.setContent(JSON.stringify({ message: "Hello" }));
    response.setContentTypeAsJson();
}
----

**Important:** JavaScript plugins run on virtual threads too - no async/await needed!

== Performance Characteristics

**Startup Time:** ~100ms (with standard plugins)  
**Memory Footprint:** ~50MB heap (configurable)  
**Request Latency:** Sub-millisecond for simple operations  
**Throughput:** Hundreds of thousands of requests per second  
**GraalVM Native:** ~40MB binary, instant startup (<10ms)
