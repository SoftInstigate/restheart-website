=== Introduction

RESTHeart provides **Authentication** and **Authorization** services. It supports different authentication and authorization schemes, including users and permissions stored in MongoDB collections.

The default configuration enables `mongoRealmAuthenticator` and `mongoAclAuthorizer`. These plugins use MongoDB collections (by default `/users` and `/acl`) to store user credentials and permissions.

=== Security Documentation Guide

This section provides comprehensive security documentation. Here's how to navigate it based on your needs:

**Getting Started**

**Core Concepts**

* link:/docs/security/authentication[Authentication] - Learn about different authentication mechanisms (Basic, JWT, Cookie)
* link:/docs/security/authorization[Authorization] - Understand how RESTHeart authorizes requests using ACLs
* link:/docs/security/how-clients-authenticate[How Clients Authenticate] - See practical examples of client authentication

**Managing Security**

* link:/docs/security/permissions[Permission Management] - Comprehensive guide to ACL permissions with examples

**Production Deployment**

* link:/docs/security/tls[Configure TLS] - Enable HTTPS for secure communication

TIP: If you're new to RESTHeart security, start with the link:/docs/security/tutorial[Security Tutorial] for a practical introduction.

RESTHeart can also store users and permissions in configuration files using `fileRealmAuthenticator` and `fileAclAuthorizer`. You need to update the configuration to enable these plugins.



=== Understanding RESTHeart security

RESTHeart uses a **pluggable architecture**. It includes strong security features, and you can extend it by implementing plugins.

In RESTHeart, everything is a plugin: Authentication Mechanisms, Authenticators, Authorizers, Token Managers, and Services.

**Authentication Mechanisms** handle different authentication schemes.
For example, _BasicAuthMechanism_ handles Basic Authentication. It extracts credentials from request headers and passes them to an Authenticator for verification.

Another example is _IdentityAuthMechanism_, which binds requests to a single identity from configuration. This mechanism doesn't require an Authenticator to build the account.

RESTHeart allows defining several mechanisms. When a request arrives, the `authenticate()` method is called on each mechanism until one of these occurs:

-   no `VETOER` denies it and at least one `ALLOWER` allows it &#8594; the request proceeds to Authorization phase;
-   The list of mechanisms is exhausted &#8594; the request fails with code `401 Unauthorized`.

The **Authenticator** verifies credentials extracted by Authentication Mechanisms. For example, _BasicAuthMechanism_ extracts credentials as username and password. The Authenticator can check these against a database or LDAP server. Note that some Authentication Mechanisms don't require an Authenticator to build the Account.

The **Authorizer** checks if the user can perform the request against an Access Control List. For example, `mongoAclAuthorizer` checks if the request is allowed by looking at permissions defined in a MongoDB collection.

The **Token Manager** generates and validates auth-tokens. When a client successfully authenticates, the Token Manager generates an auth-token returned in the `Auth-Token` response header. This token can authenticate further requests. This requires an Authentication Manager to handle it using the Token Manager for token validation.

A **Service** is a simple way to implement Web Services that expose additional custom logic.
