== Overview

This guide walks you through creating your first webhook in RESTHeart.

== Prerequisites

{% include get-restheart.adoc %}

You'll also need:

* Administrator permissions on your service
* A target URL to receive webhooks (use https://httpbin.org/post for testing)

== Enable the Plugin

Log in to RESTHeart Cloud at https://cloud.restheart.com, navigate to your service, click the *Plugins* tab, and enable the *Webhook Plugin*. No additional configuration required.

== Create a Webhook

From the plugin settings, click *Add Webhook* and configure:

*Name*: Something descriptive like "New User Notification"

*Target URL*: Where to send the webhook
[source]
----
https://httpbin.org/post
----

*Condition*: When to trigger the webhook
[source]
----
path('/users') and method('POST')
----

*Timeout*: Maximum wait time in milliseconds (default: 5000)

*Headers* (optional): JSON object for authentication
[source,json]
----
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer your-api-token"
}
----

== Understanding Conditions

Conditions use MongoDB-style predicates:

`path('/users')` matches exact paths

`path-prefix('/data')` matches paths starting with /data

`path-template('/users/{id}')` matches parameterized paths

`method('POST')` matches HTTP methods

`response-code(201)` matches response status codes

Combine with `and` / `or`:
[source]
----
path('/orders') and method('POST') and response-code(201)
----

== Test Your Webhook

Click *Test Webhook* to verify configuration. The system sends a sample request to your target URL and shows the response. HTTPBin echoes back the received data in the response.

Sample test payload:
[source,json]
----
{
  "service": {"id": "your-service-id"},
  "timestamp": "2025-11-18T10:30:00Z",
  "request": {
    "method": "POST",
    "path": "/users",
    "body": {"test": true}
  },
  "response": {"statusCode": 201}
}
----

== Save and View Logs

Click *Save Configuration*. The webhook is now active and will trigger automatically.

To view execution logs, select your webhook and switch to the *Logs* tab. Each log entry shows the timestamp, status (success/failed/skipped), duration, and complete request/response details.

Use the status filter to view specific log types. Click any entry to see full details including condition evaluation, transformation (if enabled), and the target service response.

== Recording Feature

Need to see actual request data? Click *Start Recording* in the Logs tab. This captures real requests for 60 seconds, helping you build accurate conditions and transformations.

== Troubleshooting

*Webhook never triggers*: Verify your condition matches actual request paths using the recording feature.

*Target returns 401*: Check authentication headers are correct.

*Target returns 400*: The payload format might not match. See User Guide for transformation.

*Timeout errors*: Increase the timeout_ms value or check if the target service is slow.
