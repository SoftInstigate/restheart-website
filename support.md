# Subscription

When a company is not comfortable with the AGPL open source license or need **dedicated technical support**, then it could purchase a **RESTHeart Subscription**, which comes with:

-   Perpetual, business-friendly **Enterprise license** with optional custom terms.
-   12 months of **technical support**.
-   12 months of supported upgrades to any new release of the product.
-   Training (optional).
-   Professional Services (optional).

The Enterprise license is **perpetual** and overcomes some limitations of the AGPL v3. Specifically, it grants the following rights:

-   Use RESTHeart in **closed source** applications.
-   Distribute RESTHeart **embedded** in closed source products.
-   Get coverage against some **legal risks**, like third-parties IP claims.

_While the Enterprise license is perpetual, the subscription is annual and has to be explicitly renewed._

# How many subscriptions do I need to buy?

It’s simple: buy **one RESTHeart subscription for each MongoDB production instance** you want to connect to.
So, with one annual subscription you get a single license that allows your company to:

-   Run unlimited RESTHeart instances, connected to any number of **non-production** database instances (dev, test, staging, ...).
-   Run a single RESTHeart instance, connected to one database **production** instance at a time.

_Custom Subscriptions containing multiple licenses for multiple database production instances are available upon request._
